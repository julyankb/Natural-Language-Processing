Abstract
Background: Data on objectively measured physical activity are lacking in low- and
middle-income countries. The aim of this study was to describe objectively measured
overall physical activity and time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA)
in individuals from the Pelotas (Brazil) birth cohorts, according to weight status, socioeconomic status (SES) and sex.
Methods: All children born in 1982, 1993 and 2004 in hospitals in the city of Pelotas,
Brazil, constitute the sampling frame; of these 99% agreed to participate. The most recent
follow-ups were conducted between 2010 and 2013. In total, 8974 individuals provided
valid data derived from raw triaxial wrist accelerometry. The average acceleration
is presented in milli-g (1 mg ¼ 0.001g), and time (min/d) spent in MVPA (>100 mg) is presented in 5- and 10-min bouts.
Results: Mean acceleration in the 1982 (mean age 30.2 years), 1993 (mean age 18.4 years)
and 2004 (mean age 6.7 years) cohorts was 35 mg, 39 mg and 60 mg, respectively. Time
spent in MVPA was 26 [95% confidence interval (CI) 25; 27], 43 (95% CI 42; 44) and 45 (95%
CI 43; 46) min/d in the three cohorts, respectively, using 10-min bouts. Mean MVPA was on
average 42% higher when using 5-min bouts. Males were more active than females and
physical activity was inversely associated with age of the cohort and SES. Normal-weight
individuals were more active than underweight, overweight and obese participants.

Conclusions: Overall physical activity and time spent in MVPA differed by cohort (age), sex,
weight status and SES. Higher levels of activity in low SES groups may be explained by incidental physical activity.
Key words: Activity monitor, cohort studies, motor activity, movement

Key Messages
• Objectively-measured physical activity was assessed in almost 9000 children, adolescents and young adults belonging to

the Pelotas birth cohorts in Brazil.
• The mean time per day spent in moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (10-min bouts) was 45 min in those

aged 7 years, 43 min in those aged 18 years and 26 min in those aged 30 years.
• Males were more active than females and physical activity was lower at higher levels of SES. Normal-weight individuals

were more active than underweight, overweight and obese participants.

Introduction
Despite compelling evidence for a causal association
between physical inactivity and various health outcomes,1
low levels of physical activity are still observed worldwide.2 In addition, some uncertainty remains on estimating
population levels of physical activity, primarily due to
difficulties in accurately assessing physical activity in
surveillance systems. From a public health perspective, it is
important to ascertain the level of this behaviour in the
population and continuously monitor physical activity to
assess temporal trends.2,3
With few exceptions, most large-scale population-based
surveys rely on self-report methods.2 Data on population levels of objectively measured physical activity by accelerometry
in adults and the elderly are only available from a few highincome countries. The mean time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was estimated at 35.5 minutes
per day, using data from four countries.2 Available data on
objectively measured physical activity suggests higher levels
of time spent in MVPA in children and adolescents (<18
years) compared with adults, equating to an average of more
than 60 minutes per day using data from 10 countries.2
Two previous studies assessing physical activity by
accelerometry conducted in Pelotas, Brazil, suggested that
4–11-year-olds accumulated approximately 78 minutes
per day in MVPA4 whereas 13-year-old children from the
1993 Pelotas cohort spent approximately 53 minutes
per day at this intensity level.5 However, the sample size of
these studies was relatively small.
Therefore, the aim of the present study was to describe
objectively measured overall physical activity and time
spent in MVPA in children [aged 7 years (y)], adolescents
(18 y), and adults (30 y) belonging to the three Pelotas birth

cohorts. We also explored differences in physical activity
by sex, socioeconomic status (SES) and weight status.

Methods
Study design
The current study includes participants from three Pelotas
birth cohorts in whom physical activity was assessed
objectively between 2010 and 2013. Pelotas is a city in
southern Brazil with around 320 000 inhabitants. As in
most Brazilian cities, socioeconomic inequalities are
marked in Pelotas (income Gini-Index: 0.42). The city’s
economy is based on education and commerce. In 1982,
1993 and 2004, all children born in hospitals in the city
were eligible to participate in the study (less than 1% of
the deliveries were at home or other places). Refusals
accounted for less than 1% of invited participants in each
cohort. The three birth cohorts have been followed up at
different time points thereafter. Further details about the
methodology of each birth cohort are available
elsewhere.6–8 The study and its protocols were approved
by the School of Medicine Ethics Committee of the Federal
University of Pelotas. All participants or their legal representatives voluntarily signed a consent letter prior to participating in the study.
The most recent follow-up visit of each cohort took
place when those born in 1982 were approximately 30
years of age, those born in 1993 were 18 years of age and
those born in 2004 were 7 years of age. Unlike previous
data collections which were carried out at the participants’
homes, and where physical activity was assessed predominately by self- or parental report,9 all measurements during
the most recent follow-up visits were performed at the

research clinic. Following anthropometric, clinical and
biochemical measurements, participants were invited and
instructed to wear an accelerometer (GENEActiv;
ActivInsights, Kimbolton, UK), on their non-dominant
wrist. Follow-up rates were 68% in the 1982 cohort, 81%
in the 1993 cohort and 90% in the 2004 cohort. A summary description of the follow-up rates and the number of
participants in whom physical activity was assessed by
wrist accelerometry is displayed in Table 1. Individuals
participating in the follow-up measurements do not differ
according to SES at birth from those lost to follow-up.6–8

measurements, accelerometers were collected by the
research team at the participant’s home or workplace.
Participants who were disabled or living in other cities
were excluded from the measurements, as well as those
who were unable to wear the monitors on their wrist
during work. Women who were pregnant during the visit
were contacted after delivery and invited to wear the
accelerometer.
A total of 514 children from the 2004 birth cohort were
assessed at the beginning of the follow-up with the
non-commercial GENEA accelerometer,12 the production
of which was terminated unexpectedly. This monitor was

replaced with the commercial GENEActiv which was then

The GENEActiv accelerometer is waterproof and measures
acceleration in three axes (x, y, z) within a 68 g dynamic
range with a sampling frequency set at 85.7 Hz. Data are
stored directly as sampled from the MEMS chip
(unfiltered) and expressed in units milli-g (1000 mg ¼
1 g ¼ 9.81 m/s2). In a recent validation study, a strong agreement for the vector magnitude of wrist acceleration (mg)
was observed between GENEActiv and Actigraph accelerometers as used by the NHANES survey10 (intra-class
correlation >0.95) and the output from both monitors explained more than 70% of the variance in measured oxygen
consumption across six different activities of varying
intensity.11
For practical reasons and to increase compliance,
physical activity was assessed using a 24-h protocol for
4–7 free-living days including at least one weekend day, in
all participants. The total amount of monitored days
varied according to the day of the clinical visit.
Participants who visited the clinic on Mondays, Tuesdays
or Wednesdays were monitored until the following
Monday, whereas those who visited the clinic on
Thursdays, Fridays or Saturdays, were monitored until the
following Wednesday (Figure 1). Following the free-living

used throughout the study. Due to uncertainties about
consistency between GENEActiv and GENEA output, all
individuals who were monitored using the GENEA device
were excluded from the present analyses. As a result, only
2636 (69.1%) of the eligible participants from the 2004
cohort were included (Table 1).

Accelerometer data processing and analysis
Accelerometers were set up and downloaded in the
GENEActiv software. Accelerometer data in binary format
were analysed with R-package GGIR [http:/cran.r-project.
org].13 Summary measures used for present analyses are
the average magnitude of wrist acceleration (overall volume), the distribution of time spent across acceleration levels, and estimated time spent in 5- and 10-min bouts of
MVPA. The detailed signal processing scheme included the
following steps: verification of sensor calibration error
using local gravity as a reference;14 detection of sustained
abnormally high values; non-wear detection; calculation
of the vector magnitude of activity-related acceleration using the Euclidian Norm minus

(ENMO: x2 þ y2 þ z2  1g) with any negative values
rounded up to zero; exclusion of the first 10 and last 20 h
of the measurement; and imputation of invalid data segments by the average of similar time-of-day data points on
different days of the measurement.13 The first 10 h and the
last 20 h of data in each raw accelerometer file were
excluded because these were the maximum periods between initialization and attachment, and between collection of the monitors and download, respectively. Files were
considered appropriate for analyses if post-calibration
error was lower than 0.02 g and valid data were present
for every 15-min period in a 24-h cycle (even when scattered over multiple days). Supplementary Figure 1 (available as Supplementary data at IJE online) shows an
example of the acceleration over time (15-min averages) of
one participant, with a 10- and a 20-h section excluded at
the beginning and end of the measurement (hatched area)
and the periods detected as accelerometer non-wear time
(grey area).
Non-wear time was inferred from the standard
deviation and value range of each accelerometer axis in
60-min windows with 15-min moving increments. A time
window was classified as non-wear time if, for at least two
out of the three axes, the standard deviation was less than
13 mg and the value range was less than 50 mg. By using a
60-min time window, the method aims to detect periods of
monitor non-wear time lasting for more than 1 h, which
are the periods that would most impact on summary measures. Further, using this time window ensured that short
periods of inactivity or even sleep were not confused with
non-wear time.13
The summary measure ENMO as described above
was used as an indicator of average magnitude of dynamic wrist acceleration over the measurement period.
The distribution in time spent across acceleration levels
was investigated in 40-mg resolution. We also present
mean minutes per day spent in MVPA using an intensity
threshold of 100 mg based on 5-s epoch data and two
different minimum bout durations (5 and 10 min). The

intensity threshold is based on a recent methodological
study in children and adults wearing a GENEActiv accelerometer on their wrist while performing standardized
activity types. In this study, 100 mg was found to be
within the range of acceleration values corresponding to
walking in children and adults, a round number so as
not to give the impression of over-precision, and close to
the estimate for 3 metabolic equivalents of task (MET)
for adults.11 Bouts of MVPA are identified as all 5- or
10-min time windows that start with a 5-s epoch value
equal to or higher than 100 mg and for which 80% of
subsequent5-s epoch values are equal to or higher than
the 100-mg threshold.

Stratifying variables
Stratifying variables to describe physical activity were: (i)
sex (male/female); (ii) birth cohort (1982, 1993 and 2004);
(iii) weight status (underweight, normal-weight, overweight and obese) based on the World Health
Organization (WHO) classification of BMI for adults15
(1982 cohort) and according to the age and sex Z-scores
for BMI for children and adolescents (1993 and 2004
cohorts);16 and (iv) SES generated by a standardized socioeconomic questionnaire, including questions on household
assets, the presence of a maid, and education level (categorized in quintiles based on a principal component
analysis).17

Statistics
Descriptive analyses were performed using Stata 12.0
based on valid data from all participants who provided at
least 2 days of measurement according to the protocol.
One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis testing were used to compare acceleration mean differences across age groups (different birth
cohorts), weight status and SES. The Wilcoxon test was
used to compare means between males and females.

1963

Multiple linear regressions using multiplicative terms were
carried out to examine potential interactions between variables. Additionally, multivariate analysis of variance
through Wilks’ lambda test was used to compare acceleration distribution differences according to birth cohort and
sex. Statistical significance was set at 5%, and 95% confidence intervals are provided.

Results
The proportion of males in the samples varied from 48.3%
in the 1982 cohort to 51.5% in the 2004 cohort. The
prevalence of obesity was 24% in the oldest cohort, 9.7%
in the 1993 cohort and 16.9% in the youngest cohort. In
total, 8974 individuals provided valid data on objectively
measured physical activity including at least 2 days of
measurement (Table 1). Overall, participants provided an
average of 5.0 [standard deviation (SD) ¼ 1.0 and
interquartile range 4.6–5.7) days of measurement following exclusion of the first 10 and last 20 h for each individual. No differences in monitor wear time were found in
terms of sex, SES or weight status (means varied only
between 4.7 and 5.2 days). The mean total duration of
non-wear time was 4.6 (SD ¼ 13.0) hours across the entire
measurement period, representing 3.6% of the total measurement duration. Furthermore, 61% of the participants
had zero hours of non-wear across the total measurement
period. Although non-wear time was not influenced by sex
or SES, it was higher in the 1982 and 1993 birth cohorts
[4.0% (SD ¼ 9.8) and 5.2% (SD ¼ 12.1), respectively]
compared with the 2004 birth cohort [1.1% (SD ¼ 5.2)].
Figure 2 shows the box-and-whisker plot of average
wrist acceleration magnitude used as an indicator of overall physical activity in the three cohorts. The sample means
(95% CI) in the 1982, 1993 and 2004 birth cohorts were
35.2 mg (34.8; 35.6), 38.7 mg (38.3; 39.2), and 60.0 mg
(59.3; 60.7), respectively. An inverse linear association between mean acceleration and age of the cohorts was
observed.
Males had higher overall levels of physical activity than
females across the three cohorts (Table 2). However, an
age-by-sex interaction was observed; there were smaller acceleration differences across age groups in females, compared with males. Indeed, the mean acceleration in the two
older cohorts (1982 and 1993 birth cohorts) in females
was similar (32.7 and 34.5 mg, respectively). Among
males, mean acceleration was 37.8 mg (95% CI 37.1; 38.4)
and 43.0 mg (95% CI 42.3; 43.7) in the two older cohorts,
respectively. In both sexes, mean acceleration in the youngest cohort (2004) was higher (56.0% higher among males
and 60.6% among females) compared with the two older
cohorts (1982 and 1993).

Figure 2. Acceleration in the Pelotas (Brazil) birth cohorts.

Overall physical activity expressed as mean acceleration, stratified by cohort, sex and SES status, are shown
in Table 3. For all sex and age groups, there was an inverse
linear association between acceleration and SES. Higher
accelerations were observed in the poorer SES quintiles.
Table 4 presents mean acceleration by weight status categories, stratified by sex and birth cohort. There was no difference in overall physical activity by weight status among
females in the 1982 and 1993 cohorts, whereas normalweight females in the 2004 cohort were more active than
those categorized as underweight or obese. Among males
there were differences in the means of acceleration in dissimilar groups of weight status across the three cohorts.
Normal-weight individuals had consistently higher acceleration means, especially compared with those categorized
as underweight or obese.
Figure 3 and Supplementary Table 1 (available as
Supplementary data at IJE online) show the acceleration
distribution of time spent in 40-mg categories (intensity)
for the three birth cohorts stratified by sex. The distributions were different across birth cohorts in both sexes;
more time per day was spent at lower activity intensities in
the oldest cohort, compared with the younger ones.
Data on time spent in MVPA using the two different
bout criteria (5 and 10 min) are displayed in Table 5. Mean
MVPA in 10-min bouts were 26 (95% CI 25; 27), 43
(95% CI 42; 44) and 45 (95% CI 43; 46) min per day in
the 1982, 1993 and 2004 cohorts, respectively, with corresponding 29.6% (95% CI 27.9; 31.5), 52.8% (95% CI
51.2; 54.5) and 59.6% (95% CI 57.8; 61.5) of participants
accumulating at least 30 min of MVPA per day. Mean
MVPA in the oldest cohort was 50% higher when using a
5-min bout criterion; it was 35% higher in the 1993 cohort
and 40% higher in the youngest cohort. The associations
between weight status and SES groups and time spent in
MVPA were similar to those observed for average
acceleration.

Non-parametric Wilcoxon tests were used to compare mean MVPA between males and females. Non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare
mean MVPA by socioeconomic and weight status categories. All P-values were <0.001, and are therefore not presented in the table.

Discussion
The current study presents data on physical activity by raw
triaxial wrist accelerometry in almost 9000 participants,
resulting in 46 176 person-days of measurement from three
birth cohorts in Pelotas, Brazil. Mean MVPA time in 10min bouts was below 1 h per day in all cohorts, and even
below 30 min per day in the 1982 cohort. Differences were
found across cohorts, sex, SES and weight status groups.
Few if any previous studies have provided population
estimates of physical activity obtained by wrist-mounted
raw accelerometers. Thus, a direct comparison between
our results with others is difficult. However, the differences
between age groups are in line with other studies.18 The
main difference in terms of overall physical activity (expressed in average acceleration magnitude) was observed
when comparing participants from the 1993 (43.0 mg in
males and 34.5 mg in females) and 2004 (64.6 mg in males
and 55.1 mg in females) birth cohorts. The pronounced
negative difference in overall physical activity between
childhood and older adolescence corroborates previous
findings using hip accelerometry19,20 and suggests that
interventions targeted at increasing physical activity in
teenagers is highly relevant in low- and middle-income
countries.
Interestingly, when considering MVPA bouts instead of
overall acceleration, the largest difference was between the
1982 (26 min/day) and the 1993 (43 min/day) cohorts.
These findings indicate differences in how physical activity
is patterned in children and adolescents as compared with
adults. Children’s movements typically include short periods of high intensity physical activity, and therefore tend
to be underestimated by the use of long bout durations.
The marked difference between time spent in MVPA bouts
between adults and adolescents is likely also explained by
differences in movement patterns between groups.
Adolescents are more frequently involved in organized
sport activities which usually include a substantial amount
of time in MVPA of at least 5-min duration. It is also
plausible that adolescents are more likely to be physically
active at least at moderate intensity for longer periods of
time in transport-related activity compared with adults,
simply due to less access to cars.
An inverse association between age of the cohorts and
physical activity was observed in both sexes, but the differences tended to be attenuated over time (age). The absolute
difference between males and females in mean acceleration
was 9.5 mg in the 2004 cohort, 8.5 mg in the 1993 and
5.1 mg in the 1982 cohort. The likely explanation for the
age differences being more marked among boys is the fact
that overall physical activity values are much lower in
younger girls, leaving less room for age-related decline.

A systematic review reported a positive association
between physical activity and SES in low- and middleincome countries.17 In contrast, we observed an inverse
association between activity (both mean acceleration and
MVPA) and SES in all groups, similar to a previous study
in children aged 4–11 years from the same city also using
accelerometry.4 These findings are likely explained by the
fact that several of the studies summarized in the review
focused solely on leisure-time physical activity,18 which
may be more frequent among high-SES people, but one
cannot exclude socially patterned reporting bias as an alternative explanation. These discrepant findings highlight
the need for implementing objective methods when examining correlates and determinants of physical activity, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where a
significant proportion of total physical activity takes place
in domains other than leisure time.21 In our cohorts, for
example, self-reported data indicate that transport-related
physical activity is much more frequent among low-SES as
compared with high-SES participants.22
Male participants classified as normal-weight were
more active than the other weight status groups. In
contrast, this association was not consistent among females. The association between physical activity and
weight status may be differentially confounded by socioeconomic position although the observed magnitude of associations between physical activity and weight status were
almost unchanged after adjustment for SES status (data
not shown). In the Pelotas cohorts it has been shown that
low-SES females are more likely to be overweight than
those of higher SES status. In contrast, a higher prevalence
of overweight and obesity is observed in those from higher
SES status in males.23,24 Finally, caution is warranted
when interpreting cross-sectional associations between
physical activity and weight status due to the possibility of
reversed causality.
Participants from the oldest cohort (30 y) spent, on
average, less than 30 min per day in MVPA, whereas
participants from the two other cohorts spent around
45 min per day in such activities. Taking into account that
WHO guidelines recommend daily 30 min of MVPA for
adults and 60 min of MVPA for children and adolescents,
the average values reported here are below the threshold in
all cases. However, if we simply change the minimum bout
duration to 5 instead of 10 min, these figures rise considerably, reaching almost 40 MVPA min per day in those aged
30 years and around 1 h per day in those aged 18 or 7
years. These findings highlight how simple changes in analysis decisions can lead to completely different conclusions
in terms of mean MVPA and proportion of the population
reaching physical activity guidelines. Standardization efforts are needed so that studies using objectively measured

physical activity can be compared across populations, and
further aetiological work is needed to establish the possible
health benefits of varying bout durations.
The evaluation on non-wear periods suggested high
compliance with wearing the monitors. A wrist protocol
appears more acceptable compared with the traditional
waist attachment,25 and may therefore provide a less
biased estimate of daily physical activity. However, age
differences should be taken into account; non-wear was
higher in the older cohort, most likely because older individuals may have removed the monitor during social activities. Even so, average percentage wear time was still
94.8% and 96.1% of the total period in the 1993 and
1982 cohorts, respectively.
An important feature of the current study was the
collection of raw triaxial accelerometry signals, allowing
full control of all stages of data processing and a higher
comparability between accelerometer brands. That said,
raw accelerometry data from different brands may still be
subjective to analog filtering, e.g. including an anti-aliasing
filter which is not present in the GENEActiv as used in the
current study. Applying different filtering regimes to acceleration signals will impact on results to a varying degree,
as demonstrated in our earlier work.13,26
Some limitations should be taken into account. The
decisions to delete the first 10 h and the last 20 h may have
caused the omission of real behavioural data from some of
our participants. However, our conservative decision to
delete this information ensured that the data used for analysis only included acceleration corresponding to periods
of time when the activity monitor was with the participant
and not being transported; the motion during delivery and
collection of the accelerometer to and from the participant
would confuse the non-wear detection. An additional
limitation is that we did not provide any estimates of waking sedentary time as no valid sleep detection algorithms
are currently available. Nonetheless, this is the largest
study to date on objective physical activity assessment in
low- and middle-income countries, with raw accelerometer
data collected in 8974 people and allowing a description of
differences in physical activity across socio-demographic
groups and weight status. The high response rate for all
three birth cohorts, as well as the high percentage of individuals of each birth cohort that provided valid data, are
strengths of this study.
In conclusion, our results suggest that Brazilian males
are more active than females and physical activity is higher
in children and lowest in adults. Further, physical activity
was lower in higher SES groups in all cohorts. Physical activity was also higher in normal-weight individuals as compared to underweight, overweight and obese participants.
Future studies using objective assessment of physical

activity are needed to establish time trends in physical activity in low- and middle-income countries undergoing
rapid epidemiological transition.
