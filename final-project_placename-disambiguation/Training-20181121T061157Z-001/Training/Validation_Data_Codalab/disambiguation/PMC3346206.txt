Background: Many medical interventions are administered in the form of treatment
combinations involving two or more individual drugs (eg, drug A + drug B). When the individual
drugs and drug combinations have been compared in a number of randomized clinical trials, it
is possible to quantify the comparative effectiveness of all drugs simultaneously in a multiple
treatment comparison (MTC) meta-analysis. However, current MTC models ignore the
dependence between drug combinations (eg, A + B) and the individual drugs that are part of
the combination. In particular, current models ignore the possibility that drug effects may be
additive, ie, the property that the effect of A and B combined is equal to the sum of the individual
effects of A and B. Current MTC models may thus be suboptimal for analyzing data including
drug combinations when their effects are additive or approximately additive. However, the extent
to which the additivity assumption can be violated before the conventional model becomes the
more optimal approach is unknown. The objective of this study was to evaluate the comparative
statistical performance of the conventional MTC model and the additive effects MTC model in
MTC scenarios where additivity holds true, is mildly violated, or is strongly violated.
Methods: We simulated MTC scenarios in which additivity held true, was mildly violated,
or was strongly violated. For each scenario we simulated 500 MTC data sets and applied the
conventional and additive effects MTC models in a Bayesian framework. Under each scenario
we estimated the proportion of treatment effect estimates that were 20% larger than ‘the truth’
(ie, % overestimates), the proportion that were 20% smaller than ‘the truth’ (ie, % underestimates), the coverage of the 95% credible intervals, and the statistical power. We did this for all
the comparisons under both models.
Results: Under true additivity, the additive effects model is superior to the conventional model.
Under mildly violated additivity, the additive model generally yields more overestimates or
underestimates for a subset of treatment comparisons, but comparable coverage and greater
power. Under strongly violated additivity, the proportion of overestimates or underestimates
and coverage is considerably worse with the additive effects model.
Conclusion: The additive MTC model is statistically superior when additivity holds true.
The two models are comparably advantageous in terms of a bias-precision trade-off when
additivity is only mildly violated. When additivity is strongly violated, the additive effects
model is statistically inferior.

What is known already?

• Many treatment combinations are fully additive or close to being fully additive
(ie, the effect of a treatment combination A + B is equal to the stand-alone effect
of A plus the stand-alone effect of B)

• Multiple treatment comparison (MTC) meta-analysis
models are available for comparing the efficacy of
­multiple treatments in one analysis
• The additivity assumption can be incorporated in MTC
models. These are referred to as “additive effects MTC
models”.

What is new?

• Additive effects MTC models are statistically ­superior
to conventional MTC models (in terms of bias precision trade-off) even when additivity only holds
approximately
• Additive effects MTC models should not be used when
clinical data or biological rationale suggests presence of
a potentially important interaction (ie, lack of additivity)
or worse

Background
In many f ields of medicine, it is often the case that
interventions are administered to patients in the form of
treatment combinations involving two or more individual
drugs (eg, drug A + drug B). Typically, several possible
combinations of some of the individual drugs will exist,
and it will therefore be important to assess how each of
the drugs interact with the other and whether one drug
combination works better than the other. For instance, if a
treatment combination includes just two treatments A and B,
we should use all available randomized clinical trial data
on each of these treatments to evaluate whether the effect
of this treatment combination is: equal to the stand-alone
effect of A plus the stand-alone effect of B; smaller than the
stand-alone effect of A plus the stand-alone effect of B; or
larger than the stand-alone effect of A plus the stand-alone
effect of B. In the first situation, the effect of adding B to A
is referred to as truly additive. For the second and third
situations, the effects of adding B to A are referred to as
antagonistic and synergistic, respectively.1
While the standalone effectiveness of some individual
drugs may often have been informed by a considerable
number of randomized clinical trials, the effectiveness
of the possible combinations of these drugs, let alone
the comparative effectiveness between the possible drug
combinations, may only have been informed by a few small
or no randomized clinical trials. This meta-analytic data
structure lends itself to analysis with multiple treatment
comparison (MTC) meta-analysis which allows for
estimation of comparative effectiveness among all treatments,
even treatments (drug combinations) that have not been

compared head-to-head in randomized clinical trials.2–7 In
contrast with MTCs of stand-alone treatments, many of the
considered drug combinations include one or more of the
same drugs (eg, pharmacotherapies for chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease). This creates a dependence between
the considered interventions which may be utilized in the
MTC statistical models to enhance precision.7 Welton et al
propose and discuss possible MTC approaches for modeling
treatment combinations based on different assumptions about
how the treatments interact when combined.7 In particular,
one can construct different MTC models in which all effects
are assumed to be fully additive (Welton et al dubbed this
model the “main additive effects model”), every pair of
treatments (drugs) may interact (Welton et al dubbed this
the “two-way interaction model”), or every set of treatments
may interact (Welton el al dubbed this the “full interaction
model”). In terms of estimating comparative effects between
all treatments, the “full interaction model” is identical to the
conventional MTC model, which would ignore dependence
between the effectiveness of drug combinations including
one or more of the same individual drugs.
Because drugs that are used in combination typically
target different biological pathways, it is reasonable to
believe that most approved drug combinations are either truly
or approximately additive. For example, in a recent MTC
investigating the effects of pharmacotherapies for reducing
exacerbations among patients with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, the meta-analysis effect estimates for
single-drug therapies, when added up, seemed congruent
with meta-analysis effect estimates for the corresponding
drug combination (eg, the effect of inhaled corticosteroids
versus placebo and the effect of long-acting bronchodilators
versus placebo, when added up, matched the effect of the
two active drugs combined versus placebo, see Table 1).8
Another source of evidence to suggest that additive treatment
effects are common is a 2003 review of individual trials
investigating treatment interactions.1 This review found that
only 16% of the reviewed trials yielded a “clinically relevant”
interaction and only 6% detected a statistically significant
interaction.1 In other words, in 84% of the reviewed trials,
the effects of the treatments were approximately additive,
and in 94% of the trials a significant interaction effect could
not be demonstrated.
Despite the likelihood of additivity or approximate additivity of treatment effects, the available randomized clinical trial
data as well as the current understanding of the pharmacology
of the agents may not suffice to warrant that an assumption of
additivity be incorporated in the statistical model. The additive

Notes: The example presents the effects of four pharmacotherapies, ie, roflumilast, long-acting bronchodilators, long-acting muscarinic agents, and inhaled corticosteroids,
for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease from a recent multiple treatment comparison. The effect is measured as a ratio of incidence rates of exacerbations. *Under the
additivity assumption the comparative effect of A + B versus A is identical to the effect of B versus placebo.

effects MTC model facilitates a notable increase in precision if
the additivity assumptions are correct. However, if the additivity assumption is incorrect, statistical bias will result for some
of the involved treatment effect estimates. Thus, there is a need
to explore how the additive effects MTC model compared
with the conventional MTC model trades off ­precision and
statistical bias. Therefore, to inform this issue, we performed a
simulation study comparing the precision (measured as coverage and power) and statistical bias (measured as proportion
of overestimates and underestimates) under the two MTC
models for scenarios varying from fully additive to strongly
antagonistic. The objective of this study was to evaluate the
comparative statistical performance (bias-precision trade-off)
of the conventional MTC model and the additive effects MTC
model in MTC scenarios where additivity holds true, where
there is a mild antagonistic interaction, and where there is a
strong antagonistic interaction.

Materials and methods
Statistical models
The two statistical models, ie, the conventional MTC model and
the additive effects MTC model, have the following setup.

Clinical Epidemiology 2012:4

Model 1: conventional MTC model
Let k denote any active treatment and let b denote some
­reference treatment (eg, placebo). Let θjk denote the measured
effect on the desired modeling scale (eg, log-odds) in the
treatment arm with treatment k in trial j. Let δjk denote
the trial-level comparative treatment effect (eg, log odds
ratio [OR]) of treatment k versus treatment b in trial j. Let
dk denote the overall treatment effect of treatment k versus b.
The comparative treatment effects in the treatment network
are then modeled as follows:
θjk = µj + δjbk ⋅ 1[k>b]
δjbk ∼ N(dk , σbk2)
dhk = dk − dh
where µj denotes the study-level baseline effect which
is regarded as a nuisance parameter, where σbk2 is the
between-trial variance associated with d k, and where
dhk is the overall comparative effect of treatment k versus
treatment h. With this setup, treatment combinations are
modeled as unrelated to the individual treatment they are
made up of. For example, with three individual treatments,
A, B, and C, and four possible treatment combinations

hereof, A + B, A + C, B + C, and A + B + C, all seven are
treated as distinct.

Model 2: additive effects MTC model
Under the additive effects MTC model, the effects of the
­individual treatments are modeled both as individual ­treatments
and through the effects of treatment combinations assuming
additivity. Treatment k is either a stand-alone treatment or a
combination of a set of the considered treatments, eg, A, B, C.
Mathematically, we let X ⊂ k denote that the treatment X is
part of the treatment combination that makes up treatment k
(note that X can also be the only treatment that is, if treatment
k is a stand-alone treatment). Under the additive effects model,
the treatment effect of k (versus some reference treatment b),
dk, is modeled as follows:7
dk = dA ⋅ 1[A ⊂ k] + dB ⋅ 1[B ⊂ k] + dC ⋅ 1[C ⊂ k] + …
The remaining parameters are modeled as in model 1, ie,
the conventional MTC model.

Simulation setup
We were primarily interested in the three scenarios: the
two treatments are completely additive, so adding B to A
provides the same relative benefit as adding B to nothing (ie,
placebo, P); the two treatments produce a mild but potentially
relevant antagonistic interaction, so adding B to A provides
a smaller relative benefit than adding B to nothing; the two
treatments produce a strong antagonistic interaction, so adding
B to A is the same as adding nothing to A. In the first situation
the OR of the effect of A + B (compared with placebo),
ie, ORA+B,P, is simply equal to the OR for A, ORA,P, multiplied
by the OR of B, ORB,P. In the second and third situations
(and in a setting where the interaction is synergistic) ORA+B,P
is equal to the same product, but additionally multiplied by
some interaction ratio, IRAB, that indicates the magnitude with
which the interaction is antagonistic or synergistic.1

ORA+B,P = 1.40 as an appropriate representation of the two
treatments producing a strong antagonistic interaction (in
this situation the corresponding IRAB is equal to 0.833). We
did not consider synergistic interactions since we do not
believe these occur frequently with modern day treatment
comparisons.
As shown in Figure 1, we simulated four different treatment networks:
• a full completely connected network
• a “square” network, including the four comparisons
P versus A, P versus B, A versus A + B, and B versus
A+B
• a “horseshoe” network, including the three comparisons
P versus A, P versus B, and A versus A + B
• a “star” network including the three comparisons
P ­versus A, P versus B, and P versus A + B.
These four networks were specifically chosen as they
were highly represented in two recent respirology MTCs.8,9
For all simulations, we simulated five two-arm trials for all
included comparisons in the network. We simulated trial
sample sizes by sampling the trial sample size with equal
probability from all integers between 100 and 500 and
between 500 and 1500. The number of patients in each intervention arm was set to half of the trial sample size (rounded
up if the trial sample size was an odd number). These sample
sizes were based on observations of subtreatment networks
of two recent respirology MTCs.8,9 For all simulations, we
assumed an average control group risk of 40%, and sampled
the realized trial control group risk from a uniform distribution between 30% and 50%. For all simulations, we assumed
A

ORA+B,P = ORA,P * ORB,P * IRAB
(ie, log[ORA+B,P] = log[ORA,P] + log[ORB,P] + log[IRAB])
For all simulations, we set the true treatment effects of
A versus P and B versus P, expressed as OR to ORA = 1.40
and ORB = 1.20. For the first situation, where the two
treatments are completely additive, ORA+B,P = 1.68 (and the
corresponding IRAB is equal to 1). For the second situation, we
considered ORA+B,P = 1.50 as an appropriate representation of
the two treatments producing a mild but potentially relevant
antagonistic interaction (in this situation the corresponding
IRAB is equal to 0.890). For the third situation, we considered

a “common” heterogeneity ­variance on the log OR scale of
0.10 for all comparisons. Again, the chosen parameter values
and parameter value ranges were extrapolated from recent
respirology MTCs, and were selected to create a “common” yet generalizable set of MTC scenarios.8,9 In total, we
simulated combinations of four different network structures,
two different trial sample size distributions, and three different interactions of A and B. Thus, we simulated a total
of 24 scenarios.

Models and simulation technicalities
All simulations were run from R. v.2.12.10 Each MTC data
set was simulated (created) from R, and BRUGS was used to
analyze each of the simulated data sets with the considered
MTC models through WinBUGS. 11 For each simulated
MTC data set, we used the conventional MTC model (model
1) in which all treatments are assumed to be completely
independent, and the additive effects MTC model (model
2) in which treatment effects are assumed to be fully additive.
For each scenario, we first simulated five test data sets and

checked convergence of all treatment effect parameters and
between-trial variance parameters using the Gelman–Rubin
convergence diagnostics. 12 Convergence consistently
appeared to occur before 10,000 iterations. However, to
increase our confidence that convergence had occurred, we
decided to use a burn-in of 20,000 iterations. Inferences were
subsequently based on 10,000 iterations. For each scenario
we simulated 500 data sets.

Analysis of simulated data
For all 24 simulation scenarios we calculated:
• the proportion of estimates of ORA,P, ORB,P, ORA+B,P, and
ORA+B,A that were 20% relatively greater or smaller than the
true parameter value. We believe the 20% threshold represents a clinically important overestimate or underestimate
• the coverage of the 95% credible intervals associated
with each of the above OR estimates
• the power associated with each of the above OR estimates
(we considered 95% credible intervals that did not include
an OR of 1.00 as statistical evidence of effect).

Notes: The first three columns indicate which of the 16 simulation scenarios the results on the corresponding row are representative of; columns 4 to 7 present the
proportion of underestimates under the conventional MTC model for each of the above mentioned four comparative effects. Columns 8 to 11 present the proportion of
underestimates under the fully additive MTC model.
Abbreviations: MTC, multiple treatment comparison; OR, odds ratio.

Here, the proportion of overestimates and underestimates
were our chosen measures of statistical bias, and the coverage
and power were our chosen measures of precision. We calculated the above measures under the two considered MTC
models, ie, the additive effects MTC model and the conventional MTC model.

Results
Table 2 presents the proportion of overestimates associated
with the four comparative OR (ORA,P, ORB,P, ORA+B,P, ORA+B,A)
under the two models. Table 3 presents the proportion of
underestimates. Table 4 presents the coverage of the 95%
credible intervals associated with the four comparative
OR under the two models. Lastly, Table 5 presents the
power associated with each of (the statistical tests for) the
comparative OR under the two models. Figures 2–5 display,
as in the tables, the proportion of overestimates, proportion of
underestimates, coverage, and power, respectively. However,
the statistics displayed in Figures 2–5 are limited to the

simulation scenarios where the trial sample sizes spanned
from 500 to 1500.
In the additive scenarios, the proportions of overestimates
with the additive model were consistently smaller or similar
for all treatment comparisons when compared with the
conventional model. In the mildly antagonistic scenarios, the
effects of A + B versus A and A + B versus P yielded similar
effects under the two models, whereas the effects of the single
treatments (A versus P and B versus P) were less frequently
overestimated under the additive model. In the strongly
antagonistic scenarios, the effects of A + B versus A and
A + B versus P were more frequently overestimated under
the additive model.
In the additive scenarios, the proportions of underestimates
with the additive model were consistently smaller or similar
for all treatment comparisons when compared with the conventional model. In particular, the comparison between A + B
versus A, and also B versus P, were less frequently underestimated with the additive model. In the antagonistic scenarios

(and more pronounced in the strongly antagonistic scenarios),
the comparisons A versus P and B versus P were more
frequently underestimated with the additive model. However,
the comparisons A + B versus P and A + B versus A remained
less frequently underestimated with the additive model.
In the additive scenarios, the coverage of the two models
was comparable, except for the full network with small
sample size trials where the additive model performed
slightly worse. Under the mildly antagonistic scenarios,
the coverage of the two models was again comparable,
except for the full network scenarios where the additive
model performed worse. The coverage under the strongly
antagonistic scenarios was comparable for the star and
horseshoe networks, slightly worse for the additive model for
the square network, and considerably worse for the additive
model for the full network. However, it should be noted that
the coverage for the comparison A + B versus P was similar
for the two models in all scenarios.
In the additive scenarios, the additive model yielded
considerably greater to similar power for all comparisons

when compared with the conventional model. Under the
mildly antagonistic scenarios, the additivity model yielded
greater to similar power in most cases (the only exception
being B versus P in the square network). Under the strongly
antagonistic scenarios, the two models were comparable
for the full and square networks (although B versus P had
slightly lower power under the additive model), but under the
horseshoe and star networks, the comparison A + B versus A
had considerably more power under the additive model.

Discussion
It is common to provide combinations of individual drugs
to patients. Therefore, it is important to assess the effect
of a particular combination of drugs relative to that of the
individual drugs themselves or to other combinations of
interest. Comparative effectiveness can readily be evaluated
with MTC, but the conventional modeling approach ignores
dependencies between drug combinations (and single drugs)
that include the same drug. The additive effects MTC model
incorporates this dependency by assuming full additivity of

treatment effects, and thereby gains often valuable precision.
However, when the additivity assumption is violated, the
additive effects model may yield biased effect estimates.
Our simulation study provides insight into the extent to
which the additivity assumption may be violated, and the
additive effects model will still provide a worthwhile tradeoff in precision gain versus model bias. The additive effects
model is, not surprisingly, far superior to the conventional
MTC model under full additivity. When there exists a mild
but potentially important antagonistic interaction, neither
of the two models seems better than the other. When there
exists a strong interaction, the degree of bias that the additive
effects model produces does not seem worth the trade-off in
precision gain. Considering the results of the additive and
mildly antagonistic scenarios, it stands to reason that the
precision-bias trade-off will be in favor of the additive effects
model for any scenario where the degree of antagonism lies
anywhere between the two scenarios. Thus, it seems reasonable to prefer the additive effects model in situations where
the assumption of approximate additivity is sensible.

Our simulation study comes with a number of strengths
and limitations. Our simulation parameters were informed
by real MTC examples and can thus be assumed applicable
to MTCs in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and
most likely also to similar areas where treatments are used in
combination. Being regular readers and authors of systematic
reviews, we believe that the spectrum of treatment networks
and parameter values chosen for our simulations represent
a substantial proportion of published meta-analysis and
multiple treatment comparisons. However, our simulations
may lack generalizability with respect to the parameters that
we did not vary. In this vein, we did not vary the degree of
between-trial variation or the control group risk, and we did
not vary the combination of treatment effects of A, B, and
A + B or the interaction ratio. We limited our simulation to
four treatment arms (two active treatments A and B). This
design feature is both a strength and a limitation. It is a
strength because it facilitates understanding of how the two
MTC models work at the basic level and allows for simple
interpretation of the results. It is a limitation because most

and A + B versus A (OR AB,A) under the two MTC models.
Notes: The black bars indicate the proportion of underestimates under the conventional model (model 1) and the gray under the additive effects model (model 2). The OR
parameters are ordered by row, the treatment network type by column, and the degree of additivity/antagonism by row within each sideways bar plot.
Abbreviation: OR, odds ratio.

MTCs are performed on larger networks where several
drugs may be combined, and potentially, several interactions
may occur. We discuss the implications of this in more
detail below.
As mentioned above, most MTCs are performed on larger
treatment networks. In respirology or other medical areas, this
may involve several drug combinations. Typically, only a few
of all possible drug combinations will have been compared in
head-to-head randomized clinical trials, and perhaps equally
infrequent, most individual drugs and drug combinations
cannot be compared indirectly. For example, if three active
drugs A, B, and C, and all possible combinations thereof, are
considered in an MTC, a situation can occur where A + B
and A + C have been compared with placebo or any of the
individual drugs A, B, and C, but B + C and A + B + C have
not. In this situation, the conventional MTC model would not
allow for estimation of comparative effectiveness between
B + C or A + B + C and any of the other interventions. However, the additive effects of the MTC model would allow for
estimation of such comparative effects. We could refer to such
estimates as “fully additive estimates”. Whether and when
it is sensible to combine evidence in such a manner is discussed elsewhere, and the decision to combine such evidence
will typically depend on more than statistical factors. Our
simulations demonstrate the statistical soundness of deriving
additive effect estimates in the absence of direct comparisons.
Checking that other necessary clinical and biological criteria
are met will confirm that at least ‘approximate additivity’
holds true.13 With this, authors of MTCs can be comfortable
in statistically combining direct and indirect evidence with
and additive effects MTC model.
In conclusion, the additive MTC model is statistically superior when additivity holds true, and comparably advantageous
in terms of its bias-precision trade-off when additivity is mildly

can readily be used in situations where one can only assert
approximate additivity.
