Molecular analysis of West Nile virus (WNV) isolates
obtained during a 2010 outbreak in Maricopa County,
Arizona, USA, demonstrated co-circulation of 3 distinct ge-
netic variants, including strains with novel envelope protein
mutations. These results highlight the continuing evolution
of WNV in North America and the current complexity of
WNV dispersal and transmission.
West Nile virus (WNV) emerged in the Americas in
1999 after an outbreak of neuroinvasive disease in
humans, birds, and horses in New York, New York. The vi-
rus spread rapidly across North America and was detected
in Arizona in 2003. In 2004, Arizona experienced a large
outbreak (214 neuroinvasive cases and 16 deaths, second
only to California in that year), followed by ≈50–60 neuro-
invasive cases per year during 2005–2008.
An outbreak in 2010 resulted in 107 neuroinvasive
cases and 15 deaths, the largest number of cases for a state
that year. WNV activity in Maricopa County, which in-
cludes the city of Phoenix and surrounding municipalities,
where numerous human cases were reported in the town of
Gilbert, was investigated by a team from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (Fort Collins, CO, USA)
working with local and state public health officials. Epide-
miologic and entomologic findings from those investiga-
tions have been reported (1,2) We describe the molecular
and phenotypic characterization of WNV isolates obtained
from that outbreak.
The Study
As part of the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention investigation, Vero cell culture isolates of WNV
were obtained from pools of Culex quinquefasciatus (Say)
mosquitoes collected during August 1–9, 2010, at multiple
sites in the study areas (Figure 1). Nucleotide sequences
(GenBank accession nos. KF704145–KF704159) for the
envelope (E) protein–coding regions were determined
for 15 strains and subjected to phylogenetic analysis.
The AZ10 E gene sequences were distributed in 3 robust
monophyletic clusters (designated A, B, C; posterior prob-
abilities 0.99) as determined by using applied relaxed clock
Bayesian coalescent analysis (Figure 2, panel A).
Isolates from all 3 clusters were detected from the
Gilbert study sites. All AZ10 isolates encoded the E-159
Val→Ala mutation that is characteristic of genotypes de-
scribed since 2002 (4). The 6 strains in cluster A, which
were only obtained from pools collected in Gilbert, also en-
coded a conservative Leu→Ile mutation at E-312, a surface
exposed residue in the putative receptor binding domain III
(EIII) known to be a variable site in multiple WNV genetic
lineages, including strains of lineage 2 currently circulat-
ing in Europe (5–9). The 2 strains in cluster B, collected
in Glendale and Gilbert, Arizona, encoded a conservative
Ser→Thr mutation at E-275.
To further characterize the phylogenetic relation-
ships of these AZ10 isolates, 1 strain from each clus-
ter was selected for full-length genomic sequencing
and comparison of the encoded open reading frames to
486 additional genomic sequences from North America
available in GenBank. This analysis also supported the
concurrent circulation of 3 distinct variants in Gilbert
and the surrounding areas of Maricopa County during
the 2010 outbreak (Figure 2, panel B). Strain AZ10-581
(cluster A) grouped with the recently described SW/
WN03 genotype (10), and was most closely related to
a South Dakota 2005 strain and 2 other strains that each
encoded the E-L312I mutation. Strain AZ10-91 (cluster
B) grouped with 2004–2005 Arizona and New Mexico
isolates also belonging to a clade of the SW/WN03
genotype. Other SW/WN03 genotype viruses did not
encode the E-275 mutation in AZ10-91 and AZ10-372.
Strain AZ10-892 grouped with other recently described
Arizona 2010/2011 isolates (4) and a New York 2004
strain belonging to the dominant NA/WN02 genotype,
confirming persistence or reintroduction of that geno-
type in the southwestern United States (4). Nucleotide
divergence from NY99 ranged from 0.58% to 0.66% for
the AZ10 strains and divergence between the 3 clusters
was up to ≈1.2% (Table 1).
The presence of the E-312 coding mutation was of par-
ticular interest. Most sequences for lineage 1 WNV strains
encode Leu at E-312, whereas lineage 2 strains encode Val
or Ala. E-312 lies in an exposed loop of EIII, where it may
contribute to the antigenic and/or putative receptor binding
activities of the domain (6). To assess the effects of the
Leu→Ile mutation and tolerance for alternative amino acid

substitutions at this site, we engineered 5 E-312 mutants by
using an NY99 infectious clone (NY99ic) encoding alter-
native amino acids that are each only a single nucleotide
substitution away from the wild-type Leu codon (CUU)
(Table 2). (Although Phe also requires only a single nu-
cleotide change from the Leu codon, it occurs naturally in
some lineage 1 and 2 WNV strains and was not included
in this analysis.) Mutagenesis, in vitro ligation, and tran-
scription of genome equivalent RNA and virus recovery
were performed as described (11). All mutant viruses were
readily recovered from transfected Vero cells and grew to
peak titers comparable to the parental NY99ic virus, and
the introduced mutations were stable through 3 additional
Vero cell passages.
Virulence of AZ10-75 and AZ10-581 (cluster A),
AZ10-91 (cluster B), AZ10–892 (cluster C), and the
recovered NY99ic E-312 mutants was compared with
wild-type NY99ic after intraperitoneal inoculation of 3-
to 4-week-old female Swiss Webster mice (Table 2) as
described (11). The AZ10 strains and all E-312 mutants
had 50% lethal doses (LD50
s) and average survival times
comparable with that of NY99ic, with the exception of the
L312P mutant, which was markedly attenuated (630 PFU/
LD50
vs. 0.3 PFU/LD50
, and prolonged survival time). An-
tigenic characteristics of viruses encoding L312I muta-
tions were also compared by assessing their neutralization
by monoclonal antibodies 7H2 and 5H10 and a polyclonal
rabbit antiserum against the EIII region as described (5).
AZ10-75, AZ10-581 and all E-312 variants were effec-
tively neutralized by the monoclonal antibodies and anti-
serum (Table 2).
Conclusions
Detection of a Leu→Ile mutation at residue 312 in
EIII and its apparent persistence since first detection in
the 2005 South Dakota isolate were major findings given
the variable nature of this residue in other WNV lineages
and the presumed importance of EIII in antigenicity and
receptor binding activity of E protein. Although other pa-
rameters that could contribute to the selection of E-312
variants in nature remain to be explored, analysis of en-
gineered E-312 mutants suggested that most nonsynony-
mous single nucleotide mutations at this site, including
the Leu→Ile substitution in some AZ10 isolates, have
no major effect on virulence of NY99-derived WNV
in mice and were not associated with major changes
in antigenicity.
The 2010 epidemic of WNV disease in the Maricopa
County area was associated with co-circulation of 3 dis-
tinct WNV variants. The high mouse virulence of all strains
tested suggests that signature nucleotide and amino acid
changes associated with the different genotypes involved
(4,10) were probably not linked to major changes in viru-
lence for mammalian hosts, and that all 3 variants might
have contributed to human disease in the 2010 outbreak.
Some nonstructural protein mutations have been shown to
influence virulence in avian hosts (12), and that phenotype
remains to be determined for these strains or other recently
identified WNV variants.
Detection of multiple sequence variants has been as-
sociated with outbreaks in the United States in as early as
2002 (13), but co-circulation of variants in relatively nar-
row spatial and temporal contexts, such as that observed in

Maricopa County, has been a feature of recent investiga-
tions, including WNV transmission in El Paso, Texas, and
Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, during 2010 (14) and during the
2012 outbreak in Dallas, Texas (15). These findings high-
light the current complexity and dynamic nature of WNV
transmission in the United States and suggest that co-circu-
lation of multiple variants, with continued introduction or
reintroduction of variants into disease-endemic areas, will
be a major feature of future outbreaks.
