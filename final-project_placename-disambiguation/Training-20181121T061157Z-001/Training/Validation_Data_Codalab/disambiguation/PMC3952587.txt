Abstract
Until now, there was only serological evidence that hantaviruses were circulating in rodents and infecting
humans from Madagascar. To assess the presence of a hantavirus on the island, between October, 2008,
and March, 2010, we sampled 585 rodents belonging to seven species in the Anjozorobe-Angavo forest
corridor, 70 km north from the capital city Antananarivo. A hantavirus was detected from organs of the
ubiquist roof rat (Rattus rattus) and of the endemic Major’s tufted-tailed rat (Eliurus majori). Amazingly,
sequence analysis of the S (small), M (medium), and L (large) coding DNA sequence of this virus showed
that the Anjozorobe strain (proposed name) was a new genetic variant of Thailand virus (THAIV) that
comprises other variants found in Southeast Asia. Because THAIV is suspected of causing hemorrhagic
fever with renal syndrome in humans, ongoing studies are addressing the risk of infection by this new
variant in the Malagasy population.
Key Words: Hantavirus—Madagascar—Rattus rattus—Eliurus majori.
Introduction
Hantaviruses constitute one of the five genera in
the family Bunyaviridae. The genome of these envel-
oped viruses is segmented and encompasses three molecules
of negative-sense single-stranded RNA, designated S
(small), M (medium), and L (large). These molecules en-
code the nucleoprotein (N), two external glycoproteins
(Gn and Gc), and a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
(RdRp) or L protein, respectively. Twenty-three species
are officially reported, but the number of described taxa is
increasing exponentially (King et al. 2012). Each virus
taxon is usually associated with one natural host species,
including rodents (Order Rodentia) and insectivores (Or-
der Soricomorpha) (Jonsson et al. 2010, Arai et al. 2012).
Partial L sequences of new hantaviruses have also been
recently detected in bats (Order Chiroptera) (Sumibcay
et al. 2012, Weiss et al. 2012, Arai et al. 2013, Guo et al.
2013). Infection of the host species by their respective
hantavirus remains generally unapparent. Transmission of
the virus between individuals occurs through direct contact
or through inhalation of excretions or secretions. Using
these routes, some hantaviruses can be transmitted to hu-
mans and cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome
(HFRS) or cardiopulmonary syndrome. Human-to-human
transmission is rare (Jonsson et al. 2010). There is no
specific treatment of the diseases, although treatment with
ribavirin showed some clinical benefit during Old World
hantavirus infections. Inactivated vaccine against Hantaan
and Seoul viruses are only available and licensed in China
and South Korea (Krüger et al. 2011).
Although there was previous serological evidence of
hantavirus circulation among rodents and humans in Africa,
it is only since 2006 that hantaviruses have been identi-
fied in rodents, insectivores, and bats from this continent
(Klempa et al. 2006, Klempa et al. 2007, Kang et al. 2011,
Klempa et al. 2012, Meheretu et al. 2012, Sumibcay et al.
2012, Weiss et al. 2012). Similarly, in Madagascar, there
were serological indications of hantavirus circulation in ro-
dents (Rattus rattus and R. norvegicus) and humans (Rollin
et al. 1986). We report here the first detection of a hantavirus
associated with rodents in Madagascar.

Materials and Methods
Sample collection
During a survey looking for hemorrhagic fever viruses
associated with wild terrestrial small mammals in Mada-
gascar (Olive et al. 2013), animals were captured in the
Anjozorobe-Angavo forest corridor (Anjozorobe district)
(1818¢41.9† S, 4800¢57.6† E, 70 km north from Antana-
narivo, the capital city) over four 3-week trapping sessions
conducted in October, 2008, March and October, 2009, and
March, 2010 (Fig. 1). Permits to capture and collect animals
were obtained from the national authorities. Animals were
collected twice a day, early in the morning and late in the
afternoon, transferred to the site camp, anesthetized with
chloroform, and euthanized by cardiac blood puncture.
Species identification was based on characteristics outlined in
Soarimalala and Goodman (2011). Organs were collected
and stored in liquid nitrogen containers and then at - 80C
upon arrival at the laboratory in Antananarivo.
RNA extraction from organs and hantavirus detection
About 50–100 mg of liver or liver and spleen from each
individual were mixed and homogenized at a 1:10 dilution in
culture medium containing 40% fetal bovine serum. After
centrifugation, supernatants were collected and pooled by
species (with a maximum of five individuals per pool). RNA
was extracted from pooled supernatants using TRIzol LS
reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions.
RNA was then reverse transcribed and cDNA amplified
using a nested-PCR approach, according to Klempa et al.,
using sets of consensus primers previously designed to detect
part of the L coding region of hantaviruses associated with
rodents or insectivores (Klempa et al. 2006). Amplification
products were sequenced on both strands by Cogenics (Essex,
UK). Unverified sequences and chromatograms were com-
pared and corrected when needed. A database search using
the BLAST web server (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast
.cgi) was performed to identify the hantavirus species.
Complete genome sequencing
Total RNA was extracted from liver and spleen tissues of
some positive rodents using the NucliSENS
easyMAG bio-
robot (bioMérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France). cDNA was pre-
pared with SuperScript
III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen,
Life Technologies, Inc.) and random hexamers (Roche, Man-
nheim, Germany). Overlapping PCR fragments for the different
segments were obtained using consensus (degenerate) PCR
primers. PCR products were cloned and sent for sequencing
(Cogenics, Essex, UK). The generated sequences correspond to
the consensus of three independent clones and have been de-
posited in GenBank under accession numbers KC490914–
KC490918, KC490921, and KC490923. Strains from which the
sequences were obtained were then named according to the
following designation: <name of the district where the animals
were sampled> , < host> , < country of sampling> , < year of
sampling> , and <host specimen code> . For example, Anjo-
zorobe/Em/MDG/2009/ATD-49 was the strain Anjozorobe
FIG. 1. Study site in Madagascar—the Anorana camp, in the north of the forest corridor of Anjozorobe-Angavo.

(name of the district), obtained from the animal belonging to the
Eliurus majori species, sampled in Madagascar in 2009 and
coded ATD-49.
Sequence and phylogenetic analyses
Sequences from the same segment were compared when
aligned, and a phylogenetic analysis was conducted using
MEGA version 5 (Tamura et al. 2011). Sequences were
aligned using ClustalW. The maximum likelihood method
was used. According to the best-fit substitution model pro-
posed by MEGA, analysis was performed applying the
Tamura–Neil model using a Gamma distribution ( + G) with
five rate categories and by assuming that a certain fraction of
the sites are evolutionarily invariable ( + I). One thousand
bootstrap replicates were generated.
Results
A total of 585 rodents belonging to seven species were
sampled (Olive et al. 2013). Partial L amplification was
positive in pools of organs from two species—the roof rat
(R. rattus), the widely distributed species of the family Mur-
idae introduced in Madagascar, and the Major’s tufted-tailed
rat (E. majori), a Malagasy endemic species of the family
Nesomyidae. To confirm the results obtained from the pools,
partial L detection was performed on supernatants of the
individuals present in the positive pools. Among the 231 roof
rats tested, constitutive of the positive pools, 92 were found
positive. The unique ATD-49 individual, constitutive of the
positive E. majori ‘‘pool,’’ was again found positive. PCR
products from five pools and eight individuals of roof rats and
from the Major’s tufted-tailed rat ATD-49 were sequenced.
Database BLAST searches using the sequences obtained
confirmed the presence of a hantavirus. The sequences found
matched especially to Serang virus, which is associated with
the Oriental house rat Rattus tanezumi from Southeast Asia
and which is member of the Thailand virus (THAIV) species
(Johansson et al. 2010) (data not shown).
Consequently, S coding DNA sequences (CDS) were re-
covered from four roof rats (ATD-9, ATD-56, ATD-108, and
ATD-261) and the Major’s tufted-tailed rat ATD-49. The
CDS were found to be 1290 nucleotides long, encoding a 429
amino-acid-long N protein. All nucleotide sequences were
very close (92.9–100% within the roof rat virus sequences
and 92.5–96.7% between themselves and the Anjozorobe/
Em/MDG/2009/ATD-49 sequence). In addition, sequences
exhibited 100% amino acid identity between themselves,
except for the R. rattus sequence of Anjozorobe/Rr/MDG/
2009/ATD-261, which exhibited a V69I mutation. Align-
ment and comparison of one of these five sequences (strain
Anjozorobe/Rr/MDG/2009/ATD-56) with the 1290-nucleotide-
long S CDS of hantavirus taxa showed a high percentage of
identity between this sequence and those from THAIV and
its variants Jurong and Serang viruses (97.0–98.1% amino
acid identity) (Table 1). Then, M and L CDS were recovered
from the Anjozorobe/Rr/MDG/2009/ATD-56 strain. M CDS
was 3402 nucleotides long, encoding a 1133-amino-acid-
long glycoprotein precursor (GPC). The WAASA motif
corresponding to the GPC cleavage site was identified at
positions 642–646. As for the S CDS, when compared to
sequences of the same batch of hantaviruses, the M CDS was
also found to be close to M CDS of THAIV and its variants

(91.7–93.6% amino acid identity) (Table 1). L CDS was 6456
nucleotides long, encoding a 2151-amino-acid-long RdRp.
Nevertheless, because complete sequences from THAIV and
its variants were not available, comparisons were based on
the available 1560-, 411-, and 316-nucleotide-long partial L
sequences of Jurong, Serang, and Thailand viruses, respec-
tively. Nucleotide identities with Anjozorobe/Rr/MDG/

80.8% (Serang virus) and amino acid identities ranged from
93.3% (THAIV) to 96.3% (Jurong virus).

Phylogenetic analysis based on entire S CDS showed that
Anjozorobe strains belonged to the THAIV species and were
much closer to THAIV than to Jurong and Serang variants that
are also members of the THAIV species (Fig. 2). This phylo-
genetic analysis was also performed with a reduction of the S
CDS dataset to 519 nucleotides (positions 364–882). This al-
lowed the inclusion of the sequences of Cambodian strains close
to THAIV, and of other THAIV sequences (Reynes et al. 2003,
Hugot et al. 2006, Blasdell et al. 2011). Although the tree to-
pology changed slightly and the statistical support was lower, all
sequences grouped together (Fig. 3). The clustering of the An-
jozorobe variant with THAIV and its other variants was also
confirmed by phylogenetic analyses of the entire M CDS (Fig.
4) and partial L (286 nucleotides) CDS (THAIV entire CDS not
yet available) (data not shown).
Discussion
Our study demonstrates the presence of a hantavirus in
Madagascar (proposed name Anjozorobe, according to the
name of the district where the rodents were sampled). This
hantavirus, associated with the introduced R. rattus species
and the endemic E. majori species, belongs to the THAIV
species, because the level of amino acid divergence between
Anjozorobe strains and viruses of the THAIV species is less
than 10% and 12% on the complete S and M CDS, respec-
tively (Maes et al. 2009).
Thailand virus species include THAIV associated with the
rodent Bandicota indica in Thailand, as well as Serang and
Jurong variants and an unnamed variant, all associated with
R. tanezumi in Indonesia, Singapore, and Cambodia, re-
spectively (Elwell et al. 1985, Reynes et al. 2003, Hugot et al.
2006, Plyusnina et al. 2009, Johansson et al. 2010). The
presence of a THAIV variant in Madagascar, amazingly far
from South and Southeast Asia, is probably explained by the
origin of R. rattus, which is native to the Indian Peninsula,
and has been introduced to Madagascar, through the Arabic
Peninsula, about 2000–3000 years ago on the coast, and later
in the highlands, with the arrival of the first human migrants
and the colonization of the island (Tollenaere et al. 2010).

R. rattus and B. indica are sympatric species in South Asia
and in the western part (Myanmar) of Southeast Asia (Wilson
and Reeder 2005). This presupposes the presence of THAIV
or of a THAIV variant in this area. This occurrence had been
suspected but not yet demonstrated and requires further in-
vestigation (Chandy et al. 2013).
Two other rodent species introduced by humans are re-
corded in Madagascar—the brown rat (R. norvegicus) and the
house mouse (Mus musculus) (Soarimalala and Goodman
2011). The brown rat and the roof rat are known to host Seoul
virus, whereas there is no report of a hantavirus associated
with M. musculus. During our study, we did not detect any
Seoul virus. However, our sampling area was limited to a
secondary and primary forest and, consequently, no brown rat
has been sampled. A survey exploring the association be-
tween hantavirus and rodents from urban environments could
assess the presence of Seoul virus within the country.
One endemic rodent species, the Major’s tufted-tailed rat
(E. majori) was found to be infected, carrying the Anjozorobe
variant. This nocturnal, arboreal, and frugivorous species is
distributed primarily in humid forest in the east of the island
(Soarimalala and Goodman 2011). This rodent was sympatric
with roof rats in the study area, where about 20% of the
captured roof rats were infected by this virus. Molecular
identification of the species using mitochondrial cytochrome
b DNA sequence obtained from the liver (from which the
virus was detected twice in two independent assays) con-
firmed species identification and allowed us to exclude a
sampling error (data not shown). Therefore, we suspected a
spillover event among rodents from the same superfamily
Muroidea. Because only one E. majori individual was found
to be infected, the association between this rodent and
Anjozorobe variant needs to be confirmed, particularly if the
Major’s tufted-tailed rat may act as a reservoir for this
variant.
All rodent species, except for R. rattus, R. norvegicus, and
M. musculus, present in Madagascar are endemic species
belonging to the Nesomyinae subfamily, a monophyletic
phylum originating from Africa and for which 27 species are
now reported (Soarimalala and Goodman 2011). In-
sectivorous mammals present in Madagascar include tenrecs,
about 32 endemic species (Family Tenrecidae, Afrosoricida)
originating from Africa, and two introduced species—the
pygmy shrew (Suncus etruscus, Soricomorpha) and the Asian
house shrew (Suncus murinus, Soricomorpha), an ubiquist
species that, in Asia, hosts the Thottapalayam virus (Poux
et al. 2005, Omar et al. 2011, Soarimalala and Goodman
2011). In our study, rodents from only six endemic species
were sampled, with a restricted number of individuals sam-
pled due to conservation practices. In addition, insectivorous
species have not been investigated. Extensive studies among
these animals should probably allow the identification of
viruses related to hantaviruses recently described in Africa
(Klempa et al. 2007, Kang et al. 2011, Klempa et al. 2012,
Meheretu et al. 2012, Sumibcay et al. 2012, Weiss et al.
2012).
THAIV and its variants Jurong and Serang have only ever
been detected in rodents and not in humans. However, be-
cause serological evidence suggests that THAIV is capable of
infecting humans and causing HFRS (Pattamadilok et al.
2006, Gamage et al. 2011), the Anjozorobe variant, belong-
ing to the THAIV species, may be a causative agent of HFRS
in Madagascar. We have not yet succeeded in isolating the
Anjozorobe variant on Vero E6 cells, and serological tools
are still unavailable. Nevertheless, molecular investigations
are ongoing to evaluate the presence of the Anjozorobe
variant not only in human samples presenting with symptoms
compatible with hantavirus infection, but also in roof rats
living in forested areas and close to human settlements in
several regions from Madagascar to determine the risk for
human infection.
