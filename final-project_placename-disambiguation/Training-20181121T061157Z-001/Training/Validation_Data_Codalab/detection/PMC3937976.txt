Background Between 1997 and 2009, a number of key malaria control interventions were implemented in the Kilombero and Ulanga Districts in
south central Tanzania to increase insecticide-treated nets (ITN)
coverage and improve access to effective malaria treatment. In
this study we estimated the contribution of these interventions to
observed decreases in child mortality.
Methods

The local Health and Demographic Surveillance Site (HDSS) provided monthly estimates of child mortality rates (age 1 to 5 years)
expressed as cases per 1000 person-years (c/1000py) between 1997
and 2009. We conducted a time series analysis of child mortality
rates and explored the contribution of rainfall and household food
security. We used Poisson regression with linear and segmented
effects to explore the impact of malaria control interventions on
mortality.

Results

Child mortality rates decreased by 42.5% from 14.6 c/1000py in
1997 to 8.4 c/1000py in 2009. Analyses revealed the complexity of
child mortality patterns and a strong association with rainfall and
food security. All malaria control interventions were associated with
decreases in child mortality, accounting for the effect of rainfall and
food security.

Conclusions Reaching the fourth Millenium Development Goal will require the
contribution of many health interventions, as well as more general
improvements in socio-environmental and nutritional conditions.
Distinguishing between the effects of these multiple factors is difficult and represents a major challenge in assessing the effect of
routine interventions. However, this study suggests that credible
estimates can be obtained when high-quality data on the most
important factors are available over a sufficiently long time period.

CHILD MORTALITY PATTERNS IN RURAL TANZANIA

Background
Child mortality is a leading indicator of child health
and overall development. In sub-Saharan Africa, malaria, diarrhoea and pneumonia are responsible for
more than half the deaths of children under five
years of age, whereas more than a third of all child
deaths are attributed to undernutrition. Malaria control strategies are therefore instrumental in reaching
the fourth Millennium Development Goal of reducing
the under-five mortality rate by two-thirds worldwide
between 1990 and 2015, in combination with targeted
efforts to fight pneumonia and diarrhoea while bolstering nutrition.1
The past 10 years have seen a steep rise in international funding for malaria, with disbursements reaching their highest ever levels in 2011 at US$ 2 billion.2
Since the Abuja Declaration in 2000, malaria control
strategies have focused on achieving high coverage of
insecticide treated nets (ITNs), access to prompt and
effective treatment for malaria and the protection of
pregnant mothers with intermittent presumptive
treatment.3 In recent years, the number of tools available to fight malaria has increased, and now includes
long lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), rapid diagnostic
tests (RDTs) and a renewed faith in the feasibility of
implementing indoor residual spraying (IRS) in some
settings.4
A number of key malaria control interventions have
been implemented in the Kilombero and Ulanga districts in south central Tanzania to increase ITN coverage and improve access to effective malaria treatment.
First, the KINET project5,6 was piloted to promote and
subsidize ITNs between 1997 and 1999. The project
was subsequently up-scaled nationwide within the
frame of the Tanzania National Voucher Scheme
(TNVS).7 There were two changes in the national
policy for first-line treatment of malaria, from chloroquine to sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) in 2001
and from SP to the artemisinin-combination therapy
(ACT) artemether-lumefantrine (ALu) in 2007. In
2002 the facility-based Integrated Management of
Childhood Illness (IMCI) interventions for improved
case management in health facilities and health
system strengthening8,9 were introduced. Finally between 2004 and 2008 the ACCESS programme was implemented to improve access to prompt and effective
malaria treatment by targeting both users and providers.10 Within the frame of the ACCESS programme, social marketing campaigns for improved
treatment-seeking were conducted, nearly 200
Accredited Drug Dispensing Outlets (ADDOs) were
opened11,12 and the staff from health facilities attended a refresher training on IMCI case
management.10,13
A number of studies have been conducted on these
malaria control interventions. Some studies used child
mortality as an endpoint,6,8 some have focused on
indicators of malaria transmission14–17 and others
have assessed changes in treatment outcomes.18

205

However, no study to date has assessed the impact
of all of these interventions on child mortality in
the Kilombero and Ulanga Districts using a standardized methodology. In addition, other factors such as
climatic conditions and agricultural production have
not been considered as part of measuring impact on
mortality. The availability of demographic time series
and contextual data from the local Health and Demographic and Surveillance Site (HDSS)19 provides a
unique opportunity to perform an interrupted time
series analysis to assess the contribution of malaria
interventions to decreases in child mortality.

Methods
Study setting
This study was conducted using data collected in
the frame of the Ifakara HDSS in the Kilombero
and Ulanga Districts in south central Tanzania
(Figure 1). The HDSS was established in 1996 and
covers 25 villages (13 in Kilombero and 12 in
Ulanga).20 The population under surveillance in
1998 was just over 56 000 in 1997 and around
98 000 in 2009. The area is characterized by a rainy
season from November to May. Historically, malaria
transmission was intense and perennial21 but it has
decreased considerably in recent years.22
Data collection and processing
Mortality rates
The HDSS provided all data on all-cause mortality by
month from January 1997 to December 2009. We calculated estimates of child mortality rates as the
number of deaths occurring between 1 and 5 years
of age per 1000 person-years of exposure (c/1000py).
Malaria control interventions
The HDSS routinely collected data on ITN ownership
(percentage of households owning at least one mosquito net) for the 13 years’ observation period. From
2002, the majority of the nets were treated with insecticide. ITN household ownership increased steadily
from 37% in 1997 to above 90% in 2005 and remained
high thereafter. Dates for the two changes in first-line
treatment policy for malaria were extracted from
existing publications: August 2001 for the change
from chloroquine to SP23 and January 2007 for the
change from SP to ALu.24 The start date of the IMCI
interventions was set in April 2002 (D. Maganga and
M. Mawalla, Malaria and IMCI Focal Persons in 2002
in Kilombero and Ulanga Districts, respectively). The
start date of the ACCESS interventions was set in
November 2004, which coincides with the start of
the ACCESS social marketing campaigns and health
facility refresher trainings, whereas the ADDOs were
piloted (and subsequently rolled out) in 2006.11,12
Figure 2 shows the coverage of these malaria control
interventions over time.

CHILD MORTALITY PATTERNS IN RURAL TANZANIA

Rainfall and household food security data
The Kilombero Agricultural Training and Research
Institute (KATRIN) provided monthly total rainfall
data (mm) collected from gauges located just outside
Ifakara town. We obtained yearly agricultural yield
data (t/ha) of rice and maize from the Kilombero
District Agricultural and Livestock Development
Office (DALDO). Because of the proximity and environmental similarity of the districts, we extrapolated
the values of the Kilombero District to the Ulanga
District.
We constructed a proxy for monthly household food
security (kg/household) on the basis of agricultural
yield data and information describing the local farmers’ agricultural practices. Over 95% of the HDSS
population reported farming as their main activity.20
Rice is the main staple food and the most important
cash crop, but maize and other crops are also grown
for household consumption.20 First we estimated
average household agricultural production per year,
as the sum of the products of a year’s crop yield
times the average area dedicated to each crop per
household, which is 1.5 hectare (ha) for rice and
0.24 ha for maize25 (data on other crops were not
available for these calculations). We then calculated
a proxy for household food security based on the fact
that rice availability peaks in June and maize in
March, when they are harvested.25,26 Although rice
harvest is completed in June, we assumed that 1/10
of the rice harvest was available in May when harvesting starts. Given that, on average, farmers sell half
of their rice crops,25,27 we applied a composite decay
function for rice from June onwards. The half kept for
personal consumption was assumed to decrease linearly every month (1/12 of half of the initial amount
per month). The half sold was assumed to decrease at
an exponential rate (1/2 of the amount in the previous month every month), to account for the fact that
larger quantities are sold in the months immediately
following harvest and most of the rice is sold by the
beginning of the rainy season.26 We assumed that
maize availability decreased linearly over time from
March onwards (1/12 of the initial amount per
month), given that it is primarily farmed for household consumption.26

Statistical analysis
First we graphed and described the time series of
mortality, rainfall and agricultural yield to identify
trends over time, interannual differences and correlations. Time series analyses were subsequently conducted on the monthly rates in two stages as
described below. Intercooled Stata 12 (Stata Corp.,
College Station, TX, USA) was used for all data management and analyses.
Stage 1: Effect of rainfall and food security
In the first stage of analysis we built a multivariate
time series model of child mortality rates accounting

207

for the effects of rainfall and food security. We
assumed that child deaths in month i arose from a
Poisson distribution, and thus fitted the following
multivariate model:
logði Þ ¼ logðYi Þ þ

þ

1 x1i

þ ... þ

n xni

þ ei
ðModel 1Þ

where i ¼ 1 to 156 and denotes the number of months
from January 1997 to December 2009; mi is the expected value of the mortality rate at month i; Yi are
the person-years exposed at month i; log(Yi) is an
offset term that ensures that the log rate is being
modelled on the log scale; a is the estimated baseline
mortality rate at month i; the parameters 1 to n
are the estimated regression coefficients for the independent covariates x1 to xn and ei denotes the error
term, independently and normally distributed. As
there was evidence of overdispersion in the data, we
set the scale parameter to the Pearson 2 statistic
divided by the residual degrees of freedom.
Plots of rates over time revealed both a time trend
and seasonal patterns. We accounted for the time
trend by including a continuous variable denoting
time at a certain month i, denoted as ti, as one of
the covariates. To model seasonality, we included
the following transformations of time: sin(2pt/T)
and cos(2pt/T) with values T ¼ 3, 6 and 12.28 To
model the effect of rainfall and food security, we
first plotted mortality rates against the following
transformations of rainfall and food security: raw
values, values lagged by 1 month, values lagged by
2 months, moving averages of the current and previous month and moving average of the current and 2
previous months. The effect of rainfall was estimated
for every 500 mm in mean total monthly rainfall and
the effect of food security for every 500 kg increase in
household food security. Since plots showed approximately linear relationships with the log-transformed
mortality rate (albeit with potential curvatures) we
explored the effect of each variable in univariate regression models. Non-linear relationships were
explored for each variable by introducing quadratic
and cubic terms (variable exponentiated to the
second and third power, respectively) in the regression. Interactions between rainfall and food security
were tested, whereby the effect of rainfall was
allowed to differ between months of higher food security (June–November) and months of lower food
security (December–May).
Variables shown to have an effect on the mortality
rates in the univariate analysis (Wald test probability
values <0.05) were chosen as candidates for the
multivariate model. If multiple transformations of
the same variable were found to be associated with
mortality rates, the variable with the strongest linear
association (as estimated by the parameter) in the
univariate model was entered in the multivariate
model, along with any significant quadratic or cubic
effect. Collinearity was checked by calculating the

208

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY

correlation coefficient between the candidate variables
to decide which variables to include in the multivariate model. In addition, the best fit pair of sine and
cosine functions for seasonality were entered in the
multivariate model (Wald test probability values of
either function <0.05). The multivariate model was
built by backward elimination of variables (Wald
test probability values <0.2).
We performed various diagnostic tests to ensure that
the model provided an adequate fit to the data. Serial
autocorrelation of the residuals was checked by examining the autocorrelation function (ACF) plot and the
partial autocorrelation (PACF) plot. In addition, a
histogram of the residuals and scatterplots over time
were examined. The goodness of fit of the models was
tested using the Pearson’s 2 test statistic.
Stage 2: Effect of malaria control interventions
In the second stage of analysis, we built upon the
multivariate time series model above to estimate
the effect of the various malaria control interventions.
The effect of mosquito net ownership was estimated
by including the annual variable denoting mosquito
net ownership in the multivariate Model 1. The variable denoting time in months (t) was not included in
the model. The effects of the other health interventions (change in treatment policy, IMCI intervention
and ACCESS interventions) were estimated by means
of a segmented regression analysis, a statistical
method developed to estimate intervention effects in
interrupted time series.29 In segmented regression
analysis each segment of a series before and after
the start of an intervention is allowed to exhibit
both a level and a trend. The level is the value of
the series at the beginning of a given time interval.
The trend is the rate of change of a measure (i.e. the
slope) during a segment. The model to estimate the
effect of a single intervention is defined as the following extension to Model 1:
logði Þ ¼ logðYi Þ þ þ 1 x1i þ . . . þ
þ 1 ti þ 2 ci þ 3 t0i þ ei

n xni

ðModel 2Þ

where ti is now explicitly stated in the model as
denoting time in months from January 1997, c is an
indicator variable in a given month i occurring before
(c ¼ 0) or after (c ¼ 1) the malaria control intervention and t’i denotes time after the intervention, a continuous variable counting the number of months after
the intervention in a given month i. In this model, 1
estimates the change in the mean mortality rate per
month before the implementation of a given intervention, 2 estimates the level of change in the mean
monthly rates after the intervention and 3 estimates
the change in trend in the mean mortality rate after
the intervention. The effect of each intervention was
estimated in separate models. In addition, a model
taking all interventions into account simultaneously
was also fitted. The goodness of fit of the models
was re-tested using the Pearson’s 2 test statistic.

Results
Between 1997 and 2009, child mortality rates
decreased by 42.5% from 14.6 c/1000py to 8.4 c/
1000py (Table 1 and Figure 3). Two peaks in mortality
(in 2000 and 2003) coincided with below average
rainfall and low agricultural yield (Figure 4).
Average child mortality rates exhibited strong intraannual variation between 1997 and 2009. Child mortality rates were lower between June and September,
which corresponds to the months with lower rainfall
and higher food security (Table 2).
Over the 13 years’ study period, the mean annual
rice yield was 1.86 t/ha (SD ¼ 0.400) and the mean
annual maize yield was 2.32 t/ha (SD ¼ 0.446),
which corresponds to an estimated annual household
agricultural production of 2.79 t of rice (SD ¼ 0.600)
and 0.56 t of maize (SD ¼ 0.107). Agricultural production varied across the years but there was no secular
trend (Figure 3). According to our proxy measure,
household food security was at its maximum in
June after the harvest and decreased constantly
thereafter, reaching its minimum in January and
February (Table 2). The rainy season was shown to
last from November to May with peaks in March
and April, but there was strong year on year variability in monthly rainfall (Table 2). Annual agricultural
production and rainfall were highly positively correlated (r ¼ 0.718, P < 0.0001), with years of high
production coinciding with years of high rainfall
(Figure 4). However, the correlation between monthly
values was lower, and negative, given that crops are
usually harvested in the dry season (r ¼ 0.528,
P < 0.0001).

Effect of rainfall and food security
Univariate analyses showed evidence of a decrease in
mortality rates over time, and a seasonal pattern over
12 months (Table 3). Rainfall in the same month and
the moving average of rainfall in the current and previous month were shown to be strong risk factors and
there was a slight but not significant evidence of a
quadratic relationship (data not shown). There was
no significant association with rainfall lagged by 1
or 2 months, but the corresponding moving averages
did emerge as risk factors. Food security at all lags
and all its moving average transformations had a protective effect. The variables considered as candidates
for the multivariate model were: time in months since
January 1997 (t), sin(2pt/12), cos(2pt/12), rainfall
and food security. Rainfall in the same month was
chosen over the moving average of the current and
previous month, with which it is highly correlated, as
it showed a stronger effect in the univariate analysis.
Food security in the same month was chosen over the
other food security variables to minimize collinearity
as it was less correlated with rainfall (r ¼ 0.528,

CHILD MORTALITY PATTERNS IN RURAL TANZANIA

P < 0.0001). There was no evidence of an interaction
between rainfall and food security.
The final multivariate model estimated a 0.4%
decrease in child mortality rates per month, equivalent to a 5% decrease per year (Table 3). Although the
cosine function best captured seasonality in the univariate model, the sine function remained the only
predictor of seasonality in the multivariate model,
albeit only borderline significant. Rainfall in the
same month emerged as a statistically significant

independent risk factor for child mortality, increasing
rates by 36.4% for every 500-mm increase in rain.
Food security, on the other hand, had a significant
independent protective effect, with an estimated
11.5% decrease in child mortality rates for every
500 kg increase in household food security.
The residuals were approximately normally distributed and there was no evidence of autocorrelation. The
Pearson’s goodness of fit test was statistically significant (2 ¼ 189, P ¼ 0.019) suggesting that that there is
still unexplained variance in mortality not accounted
for by the factors in the model.
Effect of malaria control interventions
In the segmented regression analyses, all malaria control interventions were associated with decreases in
child mortality (Table 4). There was an estimated
5% decrease in mortality per year for every 10%
increase in mosquito net ownership. In the three
regression models fitted for the introduction of SP
(August 2001), the introduction of IMCI (April
2002) and the start of the ACCESS programme
(November 2004), there was no evidence of a trend
prior to the implementation of each intervention, but
there was evidence of a significant change in trend
after each intervention was implemented. The introduction of SP as a first-line treatment for malaria was
associated with 0.8% significant change in trend per
month, the introduction of IMCI was associated with
a 0.9% significant change in trend and the start of the
ACCESS interventions was associated with a 0.6% significant change in trend per month. In addition, the
start of the ACCESS interventions was also associated
with a 23.4% decrease in level of mortality rates.

In the model fitted to estimate the effect of ALu introduction (January 2007), there was evidence of a preintervention decreasing trend. The introduction of
ALu was associated with both a change in level and
a change in trend, but these were not statistically
significant. In the model estimating the effect of all
interventions simultaneously, none of the interventions were significant (results not shown).
The Pearson’s goodness of fit test for the model
estimating the effect of mosquito nets was highly statistically significant (2 ¼ 213, P < 0.001), but it was
not significant for the models estimating the effect of

security when fitting Model 1 compared with Model
2 (data not shown).

series modelling suggests that rainfall is a strong risk
factor of child mortality whereas household food
security has a strong protective effect. The increase
in mosquito net coverage was significantly associated
with decreases in mortality. The segmented regression
analyses suggest that the other malaria control interventions implemented in the study area were also
associated with statistically significant decreases in
child mortality. The switch to SP, the introduction
of IMCI and the start of the ACCESS interventions
had effects on the trend above and beyond decreasing
pre-intervention secular trends. In addition, the
ACCESS interventions were associated with a
decrease in the level of the mortality rates. Although
we did observe a change in both trend and level after
the introduction of ALu, neither were statistically significant (at a 5% level).
Although the endpoint of these analyses was allcause child mortality, a concurrent decrease in
malaria morbidity and transmission indicators in the
same area provide an independent argument that the
decrease in child mortality is at least in part driven by
a decrease in the malaria burden. The incidence of
fever in all ages in the area decreased from 47 cases
per 1000 weeks (c/1000pw) in 2005 to 34 c/1000pw in
2008 and the incidence of convulsions in young children decreased from 4263 to 2320 cases for every
100 000 children per year.30 An older study reported
an entomological inoculation rate (EIR) of 349 infective bites per person per year (ib/p/y) between 2001
and 2003,21 but by 2008 it had declined to 81 ib/p/y.22
Similarly, data from two other projects documented a
decrease in parasitaemia in children under the age of
5 years from 25% in 200431,32 to 10% in 2008.33
However, it is important to acknowledge that this
decrease had started already in the mid 90ss when
an EIR of up to 1400 ib/p/y was recorded34 and parasitaemia in infants and children under the age of 2
years was over 60%.35,36
Any attribution of the observed mortality decreases
to specific interventions should be interpreted with
caution, given the observational nature of our study,
the multiple potential drivers of child mortality and
the lack of yearly data documenting the coverage of
malaria control interventions. Observational study
designs are often the only feasible way to assess the
impact of health interventions at population level, but
they do not provide a strong argument for causality.
The main concern is that there may be other secular
factors explaining the observed decrease in mortality
which were neither identified nor measured and
hence that could not be factored into the analyses.
For example, between 1999 and 2004 there were
important improvements in Tanzania’s health
system, including: doubled public expenditure on
health; decentralization and sector-wide basket funding; and increased vitamin A supplementation, immunization and exclusive breastfeeding.37 Unfortunately

annual serial data on these changes were not available from HDSS household surveys nor from other
surveys such as the Tanzanian Household Budget
Survey,38 the Demographic and Health Survey39 and
the Malaria Indicator Surveys.40 Similarly, verbal
autopsy data collected by the HDSS on malariarelated mortality were not available for all the years
between 1997 and 2009.
Furthermore, although the application of segmented
regression analysis of interrupted times series is a
validated approach to evaluate the effect of health
interventions,29,41 it is not without limitations. In
this study we were unable to estimate the effect of
all interventions simultaneously, which would ensure
that effect of each intervention would be corrected for
the effect of the previous interventions. Indeed, the
model fitted with all the variables necessary for
that (all ci, and t’i variables) gave inconclusive results
since none of the interventions had a significant
effect any more. A possible reason may be the high
collinearity between the various time variables and
the resulting model instability. Despite this limitation,
it is important to bear in mind that the effect of
each intervention, as reported here, assesses the
change in trend adjusted for prior trend, and thus
to a certain extent does take prior interventions (or
better, their effect on the time trend) into account.
However, a more general limitation about time
series analyses for biological data is that methodologies to deal with the presence of potential unmeasured time-varying confounders, to model harvesting
and delayed non-linear effects, are still in development and typically require a larger time series of
observations than was available for this study. The
fact that the Pearson’s goodness of fit test of some
of our models was significant confirms that the
models we fitted did not capture all the variability
in the data.
The results of our analyses should therefore be interpreted as part as the existing body of evidence on
malaria control.42 The 5% decrease in mortality
observed for every 10% increase in mosquito net ownership is in line with Cochrane review on ITNs which
documented a nearly 20% reduction in child mortality
at high ITN use.43 The impact of the change of treatment policy from chloroquine to SP is credible given
the much higher treatment efficacy of SP upon its
introduction14 and the high resistance to chloroquine
before it was replaced.16 Likewise the efficacy of the
IMCI interventions has been extensively documented.8,9 As far as ACCESS is concerned, two studies
suggest that the combination of social marketing
campaigns and the roll-out of ADDOs resulted in
improved availability and accessibility of malaria
treatment24 as well as very high treatment outcomes.18 Although the lack of impact of the introduction of ALu is surprising given the much higher
treatment efficacies of ALu upon its introduction15

CHILD MORTALITY PATTERNS IN RURAL TANZANIA

and the high resistance to and SP before it was
replaced,17 it may be explained by the low access to
ALu in the years following the change in treatment
policy.18 An alternative explanation is that analyses
based on only 2 years post-intervention may not
have sufficient power to show an effect.
Our time series analyses confirmed that child mortality patterns are complex and multifactorial. Rainfall
(in the same month) and household food security
(in the same month) were both found to be independent predictors of child mortality. Various studies
have linked intra-annual differences in malaria to
rainfall patterns.22,44–47 A 1 month lag is considered
the absolute minimum for a biologically plausible link
between creating suitable breeding conditions for
mosquito development and the onset of disease symptoms in humans.45,47 However, we could not observe
an independent effect of rainfall lagged by 1 or 2
months (or moving averages including these values)
on child mortality despite the fact that, according to
verbal autopsies conducted in the HDSS, confirmed
malaria is the leading cause of under-five mortality.48,49 This unexpected finding may be the result
of some un-measured confounder but it is also possible that rainfall alone does not adequately capture
variations in malaria transmission in our study
setting.
The fact that child deaths are more likely to occur in
months of high rainfall and low food security rather
than in months of high malaria risk, despite malaria
being a leading cause of mortality, can be argued in
different ways. On one hand, low food security
and high rainfall are risk factors for what are considered to be the two most important causes of mortality
in the study area after malaria, namely acute respiratory infections and anaemia.50–53 On the other hand,
it cannot be excluded that malaria deaths also occur
in months of high rainfall and low food security.
Children who are malnourished are more susceptible
to malaria morbidity and mortality54,55 and, in a cash
crop society, household food security is strongly
related to the ability to mobilize resources to afford
treatment.56 In addition, excess rainfall is known to
create considerable flooding which limits access to
care and increases the risk of diarrhoea, which in
turn makes children weaker and more prone to succumb to deadly diseases such as malaria.57,58

Conclusions
Between 1997 and 2009, childhood mortality
decreased substantially in the Kilombero and Ulanga
Districts. Our analyses support the existing body of
evidence suggesting that malaria control interventions
contribute to substantial decreases in child mortality
and are essential to reach the fourth Millenium
Development Goal. Given the observational nature
of our study, it is difficult to quantify the individual

213

contribution of any given malaria control intervention, as well as the contribution of the other major
determinants of child mortality (mainly environmental and nutritional, but also more generally
socio-economic). This represents a major challenge
when attempting to assess the effect of routine interventions as well as the cost effectiveness of public
health programmes and other development interventions. However, this study suggests that credible estimates can be obtained when high-quality data on the
most important factors are available over a sufficiently long time period.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY

KEY MESSAGES
 Between 1997 and 2009, a number of key malaria control interventions were implemented in the
Kilombero and Ulanga Districts in south central Tanzania.
 Child mortality decreased by 42.5% from 14.6 c/1000py in 1997 to 8.4 c/1000py in 2009.
 All malaria control interventions were associated with decreases in child mortality, accounting for the
effect of rainfall and food security.
 Reaching the fourth Millenium Development Goal will require the contribution of many health
interventions, as well as more general improvements in socio-environmental and nutritional
conditions.
