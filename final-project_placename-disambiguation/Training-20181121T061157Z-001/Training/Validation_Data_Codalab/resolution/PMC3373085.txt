Complete genome sequencing of 22 West Nile virus
isolates suggested 2 independent introductions into
Mexico. A previously identified mouse-attenuated glycosy-
lation variant was introduced into southern Mexico through
the southeastern United States, while a common US geno-
type appears to have been introduced incrementally into
northern Mexico through the southwestern United States.
West Nile virus (WNV), a mosquitoborne flavivirus
for which birds serve as reservoir and amplification
hosts, was introduced into New York in 1999 (1) and
spread across the United States to California by 2003 (2).
By 2002, serosurveys demonstrated WNV circulation in
>6 eastern Mexican states and along its northern border
with the United States (3–5). This pattern of WNV appear-
ance in Mexico suggested a southwesterly spread across
the United States and into northeastern Mexico through
Texas. However, in the spring of 2003, the first WNV iso-
late found in Mexico was obtained from a raven in the
southeastern state of Tabasco (3). If WNV reached south-
ern Mexico by incremental spread through northern
Mexico from Texas, the index isolate would have been
expected sooner and in a northern Mexican state.
Phylogenetic analyses showed the raven isolate to be unex-
pectedly divergent from contemporary Texas strains, but
exact relationships and a route of entry could not be deter-
mined by using premembrane and envelope glycoprotein
(prM-E) sequences (3).
The divergence between the southern Mexican raven
and Texas isolates suggested that WNV arrived in southern
Mexico by an alternate route, perhaps the Caribbean. After
its spread throughout the northeastern United States, WNV
appeared abruptly in Florida in 2001, appearing to bypass
several mid-Atlantic states. This pattern could be
explained by spread of migratory birds (6); the Atlantic
coast flyway overlaps both New York and Florida, while
the Mississippi Valley flyway overlaps both Louisiana and
the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. Longitudinal avian sero-
surveys that began in 2000 showed WNV seropositivity in
at least 3 migratory and 2 resident bird species captured in
the Yucatan Peninsula from 2002 to 2003 (7). Thus, migra-
tory birds may have carried WNV from the southeastern
United States into Mexico, either directly or through the
Caribbean. Serosurveys have suggested WNV circulation
among birds in various Caribbean islands since 2002
(8–10).
The possibility of a third WNV introduction into
Mexico at the California border must also be considered. A
2003 horse isolate from the northern Mexican state of
Nuevo Leon was closely related to Texas isolates from
2002 (11), based on its prM-E sequence. We do not know
whether WNV reached California from Texas and the
Midwest by crossing the Rocky Mountains or by traveling
first into northern Mexico and subsequently spreading
north from Baja California. The latter route is suggested by
the geographic link with the first detection of WNV in
southeastern California (2).
The reported incidence of human West Nile encephali-
tis is much greater on the US (California) than on the
Mexican (Baja California and Sonora) side of the common
border. Possible explanations for this discrepancy include
differences in disease surveillance and reporting. Another
possibility is that the WNV strains circulating in Mexico
are attenuated compared to US strains, and the identifica-
tion of a murine-attenuated glycosylation variant in
Tabasco State (12) is consistent with this hypothesis.
The Study
To investigate possible routes of WNV entry into
Mexico from the United States, 9 isolates from Mexico (all
strains available) and 13 strains isolated in the United
States from hypothetical points of introduction into
Mexico (2 from Florida, 2 from Louisiana, 3 from Arizona,
and 6 from California) were compared. Isolates from sev-
eral northern Mexican states, 1 from Sonora, 1 from
Tamaulipas, and 7 from Baja California, were obtained
from a variety of birds and from a horse (Table, Figure 1)
by injection of Vero cells. RNA was extracted from first or
second Vero cell passages by using the QIAamp Viral
RNA Mini-kit (Qiagen Inc, Valencia, CA, USA). Reverse
transcription–polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCRs) were
performed to amplify the complete WNV genome in 6
overlapping amplicons by using primers described previ-
ously (12). Amplicons were purified from agarose gels by
using the QIAquick gel-extraction kit (Qiagen), and both
strands were sequenced directly by using the PCR primers

and the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit
(Applied BioSystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with a 3100
Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).
Complete genomic sequences excluding the 5′ and 3′
terminal 20 nucleotides (representing primers incorporated
into amplicons) were aligned with all homologous WNV
sequences from the GenBank library by using ClustalW.
Sequences were analyzed by using maximum parsimony
and neighbor-joining programs implemented in the PAUP
4.0 software package (13) as well as Bayesian analysis
using MRBAYES v3.0 (14) with 100,000 generations, a
general time-reversible model with empirically estimated
base frequencies, and either a codon position-specific (for
the open reading frame alone) or a gamma distribution of
substitution rates among nucleotide sites.
All phylogenetic trees placed the North American
WNV isolates into monophyletic groups with strong boot-
strap and Bayesian support values; the tree generated using
the Bayesian analyses is presented in Figure 2. The
Tabasco 2003 isolate grouped with 3 strains from 2001 and
2002 in Florida and Louisiana and more distantly with a
New York isolate from 2000, with strong Bayesian proba-
bility and bootstrap support; inclusion of the New York
grouse strain was weakly supported (bootstrap and
Bayesian probability values <80%). In contrast, a 2004
Louisiana isolate and other recent strains from Texas were
positioned basally to the large clade containing all north-
ern Mexico, California, and Arizona isolates. This
California/Arizona/northern Mexico group was highly
conserved, with <0.5% nucleotide and 0.04% amino acid
sequence divergence. The 2003 Tabasco strain was phylo-
genetically distinct from all other Mexico isolates, which
grouped with the California and Arizona isolates.
Surprisingly, despite the greater geographic distances
between Tamaulipas and Baja California/Sonora, com-
pared to the distance between Tamaulipas and Texas, the
Tamaulipas WNV strains grouped more closely with
strains from Baja California and Sonora than with those
from Texas.
Compared to the Tabasco strain, the other Mexican iso-
lates differed by 0.55%–0.66% nucleotide sequence diver-
gence across the genome. The gene with the most sequence
divergence was prM, with 0.72%–1.4% divergence from
the Tabasco strain. However, the 5′ untranslated region
was more variable with 3.0%–4.6% divergence. The most
conserved gene was NS2B, with 0.0%–0.24% divergence
from the Tabasco strain. The E gene, often used for phylo-
genetic analyses, had 0.46%–0.66% sequence divergence.
Of the Mexican WNV isolates, only the 2003 Tabasco
raven isolate had the E-156 Pro residue, which ablates the
N-linked glycosylation site found in most North American
strains. In addition, 2 other WNV isolates (GenBank
accession nos. AY490240 and AF260968) share this E-156
Pro residue despite their geographic diversity (China and
Egypt, respectively) and their placement in different line-
ages. Although the paraphyletic nature of this Pro mutation
suggests that it could be selected either during laboratory
isolation or passage, its identification in the low-passage
Tabasco isolate may indicate its presence in nature.
Conclusions
Our data support the hypothesis that WNV entered
Mexico through at least 2 independent introductions. The
introduction detected by the first virus isolation in May
2003 from a raven in Tabasco State probably occurred
from a migratory bird that flew southward from the south-
eastern United States to the Gulf of Mexico or the
Caribbean and bypassed northern Mexico. The isolation
and sequencing of WNV isolates from islands in the
Caribbean may shed further light on how WNV reached
southern Mexico. However, the extreme genetic conserva-
tion of North American WNV strains may preclude identi-
fying the exact routes of introduction. Independently, other
WNV strains probably spread incrementally from the
southwestern United States into northern Mexico. Both
northward and southward movements of WNV between
northern Mexico and California or Arizona may also occur.
Available WNV strains from Mexico indicate that the
murine-attenuated, E-156 glycosylation-negative variant
identified in Tabasco state may be limited in its distribu-
tion to southern Mexico, while the glycosylated variant
typical of US strains is widespread in northern Mexico.
However, our sampling was limited and may also be
biased because many WNV isolates were from sick or
dying animals; the attenuated E-156 Pro residue phenotype

could be undersampled because relatively benign infec-
tions are rarely identified.
The epidemiology of WNV-associated disease in
Mexico is puzzling. According to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, 2,470 human cases of WNV infec-
tion were confirmed during 2004 in the United States, with
>80% of these from areas of California and Arizona bor-
dering the northern Mexico states of Baja California and
Sonora where many of our viral isolations were made. In
contrast, only 7 human cases of WNV have been con-
firmed in Mexico. The cases occurred in the border states
of Chihuahua (n = 4), Sonora (n = 1), and Nuevo Leon
(n = 1) in 2003, and Sonora (n = 1) in 2004 (15). Our
results of extremely low sequence divergence between the
southwestern United States and northern Mexican WNV
isolates indicate that this epidemiologic discrepancy is
unlikely to be explained by genetic and phenotypic differ-
ences among WNV strains. The possibility that WNV cir-
culating in Mexico has an attenuated phenotype was
suggested by the murine-attenuating mutation in the
Tabasco raven isolate (12). However, none of our northern
Mexico isolates have the E-156-P attenuating mutation,
and all appear extremely closely related to isolates made in
southwestern areas of the United States with a high disease
incidence.
Another possible explanation for the low incidence of
WNV disease in Mexico is resistance in the Mexican
human population, possibly because cross-protective
immunity from other flavivirus infections such as dengue
and St. Louis encephalitis viruses. Although St. Louis
encephalitis virus is common in some areas of the conti-
nental United States, including California, dengue virus
infections are rare; only 157 cases of dengue were report-
ed in the northern states of Mexico in 2004: 25 in Sonora;
21 in Nuevo Leon; 88 in Tamaulipas; 3 in Coahuila; 0 in
Chihuahua; and 0 in Baja California (http://www.dgepi.
salud.gob.mx/boletin/2004/sem52). Of all Mexican states,
Baja California and Sonora adjacent to the US border have
the lowest incidence of flaviviral infections. Human fla-
vivirus serosurveys should be conducted in northern
Mexico to further evaluate the possibility of cross-protec-
tive flavivirus immunity. Newer approaches to detect and
identify flaviviral disease are also needed in Mexico to
more accurately assess the impact of WNV.
