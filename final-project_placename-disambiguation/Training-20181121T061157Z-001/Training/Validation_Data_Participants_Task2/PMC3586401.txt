Abstract Dobrava-Belgrade virus (DOBV) is a human
pathogen that has evolved in, and is hosted by, mice of several
species of the genus Apodemus. We propose a subdivision of
the species Dobrava-Belgrade virus into four related genotypes
– Dobrava, Kurkino, Saaremaa, and Sochi – that show char-
acteristic differences in their phylogeny, specific host reser-
voirs, geographical distribution, and pathogenicity for humans.
History of DOBV discovery and characterization
Dobrava virus was isolated more than 25 years ago from a
yellow-necked mouse, Apodemus flavicollis, captured in
Slovenia [2]. At the same time, cell-culture isolation of
Belgrade virus from a patient with severe hemorrhagic
fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) was reported [11].
Later, these virus isolates were found to be identical [77].
Therefore, the International Committee for Taxonomy of
Viruses (ICTV) proposed the name Dobrava-Belgrade
virus (DOBV) for this hantavirus species [10].
Soon, reports on detection of DOBV in other European
countries started to appear. DOBV nucleic acid was
detected by RT-PCR and sequencing in Greek and Alba-
nian HFRS patients [1]. Using the focus-reduction neu-
tralization test (FRNT), DOBV-neutralizing antibodies

were found in patient sera from Bosnia-Herzegovina [34],
in sera from patients of a retrospectively studied HFRS
outbreak in Russia (1991-92 in Tula-Ryazan region [33]),
in sera of two HFRS patients from Germany [38, 39], and
in human sera from Estonia [35] and Slovakia [72].
Surprisingly, DOBV was then detected also in striped
field mice, A. agrarius, trapped on the Estonian islands
Saaremaa and Vormsi [55] and subsequently isolated in
cell culture [41]. Other DOBV sequences, quite distinct
from those of the Saaremaa isolate, were recovered from
striped field mice trapped in the Kurkino region in Russia
[56] and in Slovakia [72, 73]. Meanwhile, DOBV was
molecularly detected in striped field mice in other Euro-
pean countries such as Germany [66], Denmark [44], and
other regions of European Russia [27]. Corresponding
DOBV genome sequences were demonstrated in HFRS
patients from Germany [23] and European Russia [27].
In several countries, both yellow-necked (Apodemus
flavicollis; Af) and striped field mouse (A. agrarius; Aa)-
associated strains are sympatrically present, such as Slovakia
[21, 73], Slovenia [5], Hungary [16, 17, 61, 65], and Croatia
(62). Phylogenetic analysis has shown that the viruses from
these two different hosts also form distinct evolutionary
lineages [5, 21, 73]. This finding initiated a taxonomical
dispute as to whether or not the Aa-associated strains rep-
resent a distinct hantavirus species called Saaremaa virus,
SAAV [22, 26, 58, 59]. Indeed, SAAV is currently recog-
nized as an independent virus species on the ICTV species
list (http://ictvonline.org/virusTaxonomy.asp).
Here we summarize the current knowledge on phylogeny
and molecular epidemiology of Apodemus-associated hanta-
viruses in Europe andpropose their taxonomical classification.
DOBV hosts and evolution
Hantaviruses are considered host-specific, usually being
associated with a single species of rodents or a few closely
related species as their reservoir hosts [6, 15, 18]. For
example, Tula virus is associated with voles of several
species, namely the common vole Microtus arvalis, several
other Microtus species, and the water vole Arvicola
amphibius [54, 60, 67, 68, 71]. Similarly, Seoul virus is
associated with rats of different species, namely Rattus
rattus, R. norvegicus and R. losea [31, 32]. Moreover,
several novel hantaviruses have been detected recently in
insectivores (shrews and moles) [14], and most recently,
even in bats [76, 82].
Currently, mice of at least three Apodemus species are
recognized as DOBV hosts. The yellow-necked mouse is
the dominant DOBV host in South-Eastern (SE) Europe.
DOBV sequences associated with yellow-necked mice have
been reported from Slovenia [3, 5], Serbia and Montenegro
[51, 77], Albania and Greece [1, 43, 45, 47, 48], Croatia [37,
62], and Bulgaria [53]. Intriguingly, mice of this species are
present across Europe but seem to be DOBV-free in Wes-
tern and Northern Europe. Besides SE Europe, DOBV-Af
has been found in several countries in Central Europe such
as the Czech Republic [52, 81], Slovakia [73, 83], Hungary
[40, 61] and recently also in Turkey [46, 64]. In Central and
Eastern Europe (Germany, Slovakia, European Russia,
Hungary, Estonia, and other countries), the striped field
mouse is the dominant DOBV reservoir. DOBV-positive
striped field mice have also been reported in SE Europe [5,
62]. Recently, a third natural reservoir host was identified in
the Black Sea region of the European part of Russia, where
about 20 % of trapped Black Sea field mice of the species A.
ponticus (a sibling species of yellow-necked mouse, J.
Michaux pers. comm.) were DOBV-antigen positive and
from which virus could be isolated by cell culture with lung
tissue homogenate as inoculum [27, 79].
DOBV belongs to the group of Murinae-associated
hantaviruses. Its close relatives are Hantaan virus (HTNV),
Seoul virus, and Thailand virus from Asia. The most clo-
sely related hantavirus currently is Sangassou virus, which
is found in West Africa [25, 28].
Phylogenetic analysis of the DOBV strains from yellow-
necked and striped field mice occurring sympatrically in
Slovenia [5] and Slovakia [21, 73] clearly showed that
DOBV forms distinct evolutionary lineages according to
the host species. This was clearly confirmed when virus
sequences from the third host, the Black Sea field mouse,
were analyzed. These lineages were called DOBV-Af,
DOBV-Aa, and DOBV-Ap according to the rodent species
abbreviation of their hosts [27, 30].
The strict host-determined differentiation is particularly
obvious in the sequence analysis of the M segment, which
encodes the viral envelope glycoprotein (Fig. 1B). How-
ever, in the S-segment-based trees, the virus sequences
obtained from striped field mice trapped on Saaremaa
Island in Estonia are clearly distinct from the other strains
derived from striped field mice from mainland Europe [14,
24, 27, 53, 63]. Genetic reassortment between DOBV-Aa
and DOBV-Af strains was initially proposed as a possible
explanation for the conflicting S- and M-segment phylog-
enies [21]. Discovery of the DOBV-Ap lineage required
revision of the concept. DOBV-Ap forms a sister group to
DOBV-Af in the S-segment trees, and the position of the
Saaremaa strain is now more ancestral [27]. Therefore, the
putative reassortment could not have occurred directly with
DOBV-Af as initially proposed but with some older
ancestor of DOBV-Af and DOBV-Ap.
An alternative explanation based on different evolu-
tionary rates of genome segments has been proposed [42,
59]. According to Plyusnin et al. [59], after a host switch of
pre-DOBV to striped field mouse, the housekeeping
522 B. Klempa et al.
123
nucleocapsid (N) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
(RdRp) proteins (encoded by S and L segments) have been
diverging more slowly than surface glycoproteins Gn (G1)
and Gc (G2) (encoded by M segment), which are involved
in the recognition of host-cell receptor(s) and represent
targets for neutralizing antibodies. Consequently, the M
segment has accumulated more mutations than the S (and L)
segment, making phylogenetic reconstructions easier [59].
However, the proposed host switch from yellow-necked
mouse to striped field mouse has been called into doubt by
others [19, 26]. Indeed, high sequence variability and long
branch distances among geographical clusters within the
DOBV-Aa lineage indicate an isolated long-term evolution
of the virus and suggest that the striped field mouse is the
primary host of DOBV. On the other hand, low intra-lineage
variability of DOBV-Af and DOBV-Ap strains indicates
more recent and rapid spread of these viruses in yellow-
necked mouse and Black Sea field mouse populations.
Additional conflicts in tree topologies suggesting
genetic reassortment during DOBV evolution have been
observed for DOBV-Ap. In S-segment trees, DOBV-Ap
forms a well-supported sister group to DOBV-Af but is an
outgroup to all other DOBV strains in M- and L-segment
trees [27]. More complete sequence data, especially from
M and L segments, allowing construction of more balanced
datasets for all three segments, would be very helpful to
better understand the complexity of DOBV evolution.
The inference of S-segment phylogeny seems to be
particularly problematic. Usage of various datasets and
phylogenetic methods can result in different positions of

genetic position of Dobrava-Belgrade virus genotypes (marked by
light grey boxes) constructed on the basis of complete nucleocapsid
protein (S segment) coding sequences (A) and complete glycoprotein
precursor (M segment) coding sequences (B). Evolutionary analysis
was conducted in MEGA5 [78]. The evolutionary history was inferred
using the maximum-likelihood method based on the general time-
reversible (GTR) model with a discrete Gamma distribution (?G) and
five rate categories, and by assuming that a certain fraction of sites are
evolutionarily invariable (?I), which was estimated to be the best-fit
substitution model according to the Bayesian information criterion.

the Saaremaa strains [74]. Nevertheless, it remains clear
that Saaremaa strains show different phylogenetic place-
ment in S- and M-segment trees (Fig. 1) and are evolu-
tionarily distinct from the DOBV-Aa lineage. It is
important to note that the DOBV S-segment sequences
obtained recently from striped field mice trapped on the
Estonian mainland do not share a common ancestor with
Saaremaa strains but clearly cluster with DOBV-Aa strains
(Golovljova, et al., manuscript in preparation; Figs. 1A, 2).
In this context, it is interesting to note that the striped field
mouse population from Saaremaa Island has two pericen-
tromeric nucleolus-organizer regions less in their karyo-
type than striped field mice from Estonia, Russia, or other
continental areas. This has been interpreted as evidence for
their earlier geographic isolation from the continental
populations [7]. On the other hand, ongoing work by J.
Michaux (pers. comm) shows narrow genetic diversity in
striped field mice in the Western Palearctic, indicating
quite recent quick expansion from the Eastern Palearctic.
Due to the Ice Age, Saaremaa Island has existed for a
maximum of 10,000 years, thus limiting the maximum age
of the population of striped field mice found there. All of
this suggests that genetic changes in these viruses can be
quite fast.
Although there are difficulties in inferring phylogenetic
relationships between the lineages, the following four
lineages can currently be clearly recognized according to
S-segment-based phylogenetic analysis: DOBV-Af,

DOBV-Aa, DOBV-Ap, and SAAV (see Fig. 1A, 2). Since
the appearance of SAAV in the ICTV species list, some
authors designate any strain originating from A. agrarius
as SAAV (e.g., see refs. [57, 62]) regardless of their
phylogenetic distance to Estonian Saaremaa strains and to
other DOBV lineages, Other authors emphasize the fact
that A. agrarius-derived strains are not monophyletic and
that DOBV-Aa strains from Central Europe, mainland
Estonia and Russia are clearly different from Saaremaa
Island strains. This parallel terminology has brought
confusion not only to the hantavirus scientific community
but also to clinicians and public-health authorities.
Proposal of a new classification
We would like to propose a novel intra-species classification
of DOBV, which is based on phylogenetic analysis of the S
segment sequences. Due to the genetic basis of the classifi-
cation, we propose to define virus genotypes. In agreement
with the usual procedure in hantavirus terminology, genotype
names should be derived from the geographical place where
the first sequence of the genotype was detected.
Following this concept, one can currently define four
DOBV genotypes corresponding to the four above-listed lin-
eages. The ‘‘Dobrava’’ genotype consists of DOBV-Af strains
and is named after the prototype virus [2]. Strains on the
Estonian island of Saaremaa carried by striped field mice
represent the ‘‘Saaremaa’’ genotype [55]. Since the first
sequencesoftheDOBV-AalineagewerefoundintheKurkino
region of Russia [56], we propose to define the ‘‘Kurkino’’
genotype, which corresponds to the DOBV-Aa lineage on the
European mainland. Analogously, the strains of the DOBV-
Ap lineage represent the ‘‘Sochi’’ genotype [27]. Basic char-
acteristics of the virus genotypes are summarized in Table 1.
Based on the recently accumulated knowledge, we are
convinced that it would be more appropriate to classify
these four genotypes within a single hantavirus species,
Dobrava-Belgrade virus (DOBV). They should neither be
divided into DOBV and SAAV species nor do they rep-
resent four distinct species. This opinion is based on the
following four facts. (i) The amino acid sequence differ-
ences between the genotypes are extremely small, not
exceeding 5 % in case of N and RdRp proteins and 10 % in
case of glycoprotein precursor (GPC) (see Table 2). The
current ICTV species demarcation criterion is a 7 % dif-
ference for both N and GPC amino acid sequences while a
recent proposal based on similarity frequency histograms
even suggests 10 % for N and 12 % for GPC sequences
[36]. (ii) The genotypes cannot be distinguished using any
of the routine serological methods (enzyme-linked immu-
nosorbent assay, indirect immunofluorescence assay,

immunoblot test), and in a substantial number of cases
(about one-third), not even using neutralization assays,
which are considered the ‘‘gold standard’’ for serotyping of
convalescent sera [12, 24, 27, 75]. Therefore, routine
serological methods can clearly identify the causative agent
at the species level but not at the genotype level. Therefore,
no artificial categories such as ‘‘DOBV/SAAV’’ need to be
introduced in routine diagnostics. (iii) Spill-over infections
of the DOBV-Aa strains (Kurkino genotype) to local yel-
low-necked mice could be observed recently in northern
Germany [63, 66], and the opposite situation, the detection
of the DOBV-Af strain (Dobrava genotype) in striped field
mice, was observed in Croatia [62]. Such spillover infec-
tions are considered to be transient and epidemiologically
irrelevant. However, they enable different hantavirus
strains, or even members of different species, to ‘‘meet’’ in
the same host, which is a basic prerequisite for genetic
reassortment as well as recombination. Recently, it was
shown that the genetic reassortment between the DOBV-Af
lineage (defined now as Dobrava genotype) and the
DOBV-Aa lineage (defined now as Kurkino genotype) can
occur with high frequency in cell culture [20]. (iv) Recent
discovery of the Sochi genotype in the Black Sea region
shows that the list of natural hosts of DOBV still might not
be complete, and novel hosts and lineages/genotypes will
probably emerge in new geographical regions. If the ‘‘new
host–new virus species’’ rule were to be followed, this
could lead to claims of additional hantavirus species that
could be barely differentiable from each other.
DOBV epidemiology and virulence in humans
All four DOBV genotypes have been isolated in cell culture
and were molecularly detected in their respective reservoir
hosts and – with the exception of the Saaremaa genotype –
also in HFRS patients (Table 1). Human infections by
viruses of theDobrava genotype are mainly reportedfrom SE
Europe [4, 49], and those by members of the Sochi genotype,
from the Black Sea coast region of Russia [9, 27]. However,
Dobrava-genotype infections are also occasionally reported
outside of SE Europe, e.g., in the Czech Republic [52],
Slovakia [83, our unpublished data], and Hungary [17].
Human infections by Kurkino viruses were first reported
from Germany. In accordance with the geographical dis-
tribution of A. agrarius, the infections are restricted to the
northeastern part of the country [23, 24, 38, 39, 73]. During
the period of 1991 to 2006, three large DOBV-associated
HFRS outbreaks were registered in central regions of
European Russia [8, 27, 33, 79]. Detailed investigation of
the 2001/02 and 2005/06 HFRS outbreaks have revealed
the Kurkino genotype as the causative infectious agent and
the striped field mouse as a reservoir species [8, 27, 79].
So far, only three HFRS patients in Estonia have been
linked by serological tests to Saaremaa (or related DOBV)
infection; however, no molecular (nucleotide sequence)
identification of the virus strains involved has been repor-
ted [13]. Based on the recently detected Kurkino genotype
sequences in striped field mice from mainland Estonia, it
seems likely that these clinical cases were caused by the
Kurkino and not the Saaremaa genotype.
It is highly interesting to note that the different genotypes
of DOBV– despite their high genetic similarity – induce
HFRS of different severity. The most severe clinical courses
were observed in SE Europe, where human infections by the
Dobrava genotype occur. The case-fatality rate (CFR) of
clinical cases was 10-12 %, a rate that is similar or even
higher than that known for HTNV infections in Asia [4, 49,
80]. For HFRS caused by the Sochi genotype on the Black
Sea coast of European Russia, a CFR of about 6 % was

observed [27]; however, recent studies indicate that the
CFR might be even higher (Dzagurova et al., in prepara-
tion). Whereas clinical manifestations of both Dobrava and
Sochi infections are moderate to severe, the course of HFRS
due to infection by Kurkino seems to be milder. During
the clinically characterized large Kurkino outbreaks in
European Russia in the seasons 2001/02 and 2005/06, CFRs
between 0.3 % and 0.9 % were determined [8, 27]. These
data confirm previous findings [38, 69, 73] that Kurkino
infections cause mainly mild or moderate clinical courses of
HFRS. However, during the outbreaks in Central European
Russia as well as in some cases in northern Germany, severe
clinical courses, even with lung impairment, were found
[8, 39, 70]. In contrast, Saaremaa infections seem to be
mainly subclinical. Despite the high hantaviral seropreva-
lence in the Saaremaa human population (28 %), no clinical
cases have been reported [12, 13, 75]. At the current stage of
knowledge, the order of virulence of the DOBV genotypes
in humans appears to be as follows: Dobrava [ Sochi [
Kurkino [ Saaremaa. In line with this virulence ranking in
humans, a study in suckling mice demonstrated a fatal
outcome for Dobrava but not Saaremaa infections [29].
It remains to be determined which genetic differences in
the four virus genotypes are responsible for their different
virulence. In initial investigations, we found that genetic
markers associated with the divergent virulence of Kurkino
(virus isolate SK/Aa) versus Dobrava (virus isolate Slo/Af),
at least under in vitro conditions, are associated with the
genomic S and L segments of the viruses [20].
Conclusions
DOBV is the most virulent European hantavirus and is
responsible for almost all fatal HFRS cases in Europe.
Together with the more common, but less virulent, Puu-
mala virus, it can be considered one of the two most
important hantaviruses in Europe. Its unambiguous classi-
fication is therefore of significant benefit not only for the
scientific community but also for hantavirus diagnostics,
medical care, and public-health authorities. The different
virulence of such closely related genotypes makes the virus
particularly interesting for research. Understanding the
mechanisms behind the different virulence properties of the
DOBV genotypes could significantly advance the whole
field of hantavirus pathogenesis.
