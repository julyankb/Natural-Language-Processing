Aim of database: The Danish Cerebral Palsy Follow-up Program is a combined follow-up
program and national clinical quality database that aims to monitor and improve the quality of
health care for children with cerebral palsy (CP).
Study population:The database includes children with CP aged 0–15 years and children with
symptoms of CP aged 0–5 years.
Main variables: In the follow-up program, the children are offered examinations throughout their
childhood by orthopedic surgeons, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and pediatricians.
Examinations of gross and fine motor function, manual ability, muscle tone, passive range of
motion, use of orthotics, and assistive devices are performed once a year; radiographic examina-
tion of the hips is planned based on the child’s age and gross motor function; and the diagnosis
is performed once before the age of 5 years. Six indicators were developed based on scientific
literature and consensus in the steering committee, and their calculation is based on the following
four main variables: radiographic examination of the hip, gross motor function, manual ability,
and diagnosis.
Descriptive data: The 2014 annual report includes results of the quality indicators in three
of five regions in Denmark comprising 432 children with CP, corresponding to a coverage of
82% of the expected population.
Conclusion:The Danish Cerebral Palsy Follow-up Program is currently under development as a
national clinical quality database in Denmark.The database holds potential for research in preva-
lence, clinical characteristics of the population, and the effects of prevention and treatment.
Keywords: cerebral palsy, clinical quality database, hip surveillance
Aim of database
The Danish Cerebral Palsy Follow-up Program (CPOP) is a combined follow-up
program and a national clinical quality database that includes children with cerebral
palsy (CP) aged 0–15 years and children with CP-like symptoms aged 0–5 years. The
objective of the follow-up program is to prevent complications of CP and promote the
use of standardized examinations by orthopedic surgeons, pediatricians, occupational
therapists, and physiotherapists. The clinical quality database includes data obtained
from the examinations and aims to document, monitor, and improve the quality of
health care for children with CP in Denmark.
Study population
CP is the most common congenital motor disability in childhood with a prevalence of
2.1–3.0/1,000 live births.1

definition, CP is “a group of permanent but not unchanging
disorders of movement and/or posture and motor function,
which are due to a non-progressive interference, lesion or
abnormality of the developing/immature brain.”2
Although
the brain lesion is nonprogressive, the neuromusculoskeletal
and movement-related functions do change and can cause
limitations in relation to activity and participation.2
The diagnosis of CP can be categorized into four sub-
types: spastic, dyskinetic, ataxia, and mixed form.2
The sub-
type is supplemented with a classification of motor function
using the Gross Motor Function Classification System and
the Manual Ability Classification System.3,4
Both systems
are ordinal scales with five levels of function, ­
representing
clinically meaningful distinctions in motor function. ­
Children
at level I are the least disabled, although they may have
­
limitations in advanced motor skills. Children at levelV have
the most severe motor disability. Their ability to perform
independent movements and functions is limited even with
the use of assistive technology.
Children with CP are in need of continuous follow-up
and treatment throughout childhood. In Denmark, the
responsibility for health care for children with CP is shared
between five regions and 98 municipalities. The regions are
responsible for the hospitals and thus the interventions by
orthopedic ­
surgeons and pediatricians.The municipalities are
responsible for interventions by physiotherapists and occu-
pational therapists, who are affiliated to a range of ­
different
institutions, such as rehabilitations centers, ­
nurseries, and
special needs schools.
The follow-up program and national
clinical quality database
A follow-up program and database were developed .20 years
ago in Sweden as a secondary prevention program to detect
early signs of deterioration through standardized exami-
nations performed by physiotherapists and occupational
therapists once a year, orthopedic surgeons based on the
child’s age and gross motor function, and pediatricians once
before the age of 5 years.5
Sweden, Norway, Scotland, and
parts of Iceland and Australia now use the program or some
modified versions.6
In Denmark, CPOP was started in the Region of Southern
Denmark in 2010 and is currently under development as a
national follow-up program and clinical database. CPOP is
currently implemented for children born in 2003 or later in
the Region of Southern Denmark and children born in 2008
or later in the Central Denmark Region, the Capital Region
of Denmark, and the North Denmark Region.
The annual report from 2014 describes the quality of
health care in three of five regions for 432 children with CP,
corresponding to a coverage of 82% of the expected popula-
tion in the regions. The annual report will cover all the five
regions of Denmark from 2017. CPOP is expected to be
fully implemented in 2023, when children born in 2008 are
15 years of age. Approximately 125 children are diagnosed
with CP every year, thus the CPOP follow up program expects
to include 1,800 children when fully implemented.
The follow-up program will be a population-based service,
including all children diagnosed with CP aged 0–15 years
and children with CP-like symptoms aged 0–5 years. If the
diagnosis is confirmed at the age of 5 years, the child con-
tinues to be enrolled in the follow-up program, and if the
diagnosis cannot be confirmed, the child is dismissed from
the program. All children participating in the program are
registered in the CPOP database.
The examinations in the CPOP are offered throughout
the childhood and should lead to early detection of compli-
cations, such as hip dislocation, scoliosis, and contractures
of muscles and joints.6
The examinations are reported to the
database by orthopedic surgeons, physiotherapists, occu-
pational therapists, and pediatricians across regions and
municipalities. The involved pediatric departments offer
interdisciplinary consultations, where children, parents, and
health care professionals meet and agree on future follow-ups
and interventions.
Main variables
Pediatricians perform the initial evaluation for inclusion of
children in CPOP.The examinations are planned based on the
child’s age and gross motor function as outlined in Table 1.
The examinations can be completed at any time during the
calendar year of follow-up.
Orthopedic surgeons are responsible for repeated
­
radiographic examinations of the hip and spine, including
measuring the degree of femoral head displacement.7
Physiotherapists or occupational therapists describe
the child’s gross motor function and manual ability using
Gross Motor Function Classification System and Manual
­
Ability Classification System.3,4
Furthermore, they perform
a ­
physical examination of the spine, muscle tone, passive
range of motion, pain, mobility/transfer/positioning, and use
of orthotics and assistive devices.
Pediatricians examine the child and confirm that the cri-
teria for CP diagnosis are met.2
Furthermore, they describe
the CP subtype, etiology, and other health conditions/
disabilities.

The Danish Cerebral Palsy Follow-Up Program
Quality indicators
TheStatensSerumInstitut,apublicenterpriseunderthe­
Danish
Ministry of Health, has officially approved six indicators of
quality of processes and results of health care.The indicators
were developed based on scientific literature, ­
documented best
practices from the clinical databases in ­
Sweden and Norway,
and consensus in the steering committee.
The quality indicators and results reported in the annual
report of 2014 are described in Table 2. The proportion of
participants with missing data on variables that are used
to calculate indicators 1, 5, and 6 will be reported in the
annual report of 2015 and onward. The quality indicators
are primarily based on four main variables: radiographic
examination of the hip, gross motor function, manual abil-
ity, and diagnosis. The clinical importance of the variables
varies, and the goal is to report all the four variables in 60%
of participants, if relevant. In the annual report from 2014,
52% of the parti­
cipants had all four variables reported, if
relevant.
Follow-up
The follow-up period for the individual child will be from
diagnosis, which is typically between birth and 3 years of
age, until the child is 15 years of age.
Examples of research
The regional database has been used to describe the epide-
miology of CP in Southern Denmark.8
The use of CPOP in
several countries makes it possible to compare the quality
of health care between the participating countries. The
data from the follow-up program and database in Sweden
have been published in a number of international scientific
journals.5,6,9–11
The main studies document characteristics of
the population and the effects of the follow-up program and
database on prevention of dislocation of the hip in children
with CP.5,10
Results from the first 10 years were published
in 2005, and from the first 20 years in 2014.5,10
These results
have shown a decrease in the incidence of dislocation of the
hip from 8% in a historical control group to 0.5% in the group
that participated in CPOP.5
Administrative issues and funding
Implementation of CPOP has been supported by a private
foundation: The Ludvig and Sara Elsass Foundation. Each
of the five regions in Denmark is responsible for the imple-
mentation and continued operation of the follow-up program,

which involves health care professionals across regions and
municipalities. The database is currently being established
as a national clinical quality database and is financially
­
supported byThe Danish Clinical Registries.The database is
led by a board consisting of representatives from the patient
organization, professional associations, the regions, and
Danish Clinical Registries.
Conclusion
The CPOP is currently being developed as a national clinical
database in Denmark.
Previous research studies have documented the effects
of the follow-up program and database on the prevention of
­
dislocation of the hip in children with CP in Sweden. The
objective of the follow-up program is to prevent complica-
tions of CP, and the database aims to document, monitor,
and improve the quality of health care for children with CP
in Denmark. Studies from Sweden substantiate the potential
with regard to research in prevalence, clinical character-
istics of the population, and the effects of prevention and
treatment.
