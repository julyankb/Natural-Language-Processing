Abstract
Andes virus (ANDV) is a human-pathogenic hantavirus. Hantaviruses presumably initiate
their mRNA synthesis by using cap structures derived from host cell mRNAs, a mechanism
called cap-snatching. A signature for a cap-snatching endonuclease is present in the N ter-
minus of hantavirus L proteins. In this study, we aimed to solve the atomic structure of the
ANDV endonuclease and characterize its biochemical features. However, the wild-type pro-
tein was refractory to expression in Escherichia coli, presumably due to toxic enzyme activ-
ity. To circumvent this problem, we introduced attenuating mutations in the domain that
were previously shown to enhance L protein expression in mammalian cells. Using this
approach, 13 mutant proteins encompassing ANDV L protein residues 1–200 were suc-
cessfully expressed and purified. Protein stability and nuclease activity of the mutants was
analyzed and the crystal structure of one mutant was solved to a resolution of 2.4 Å. Shape
in solution was determined by small angle X-ray scattering. The ANDV endonuclease
showed structural similarities to related enzymes of orthobunya-, arena-, and orthomyxovi-
ruses, but also differences such as elongated shape and positively charged patches sur-
rounding the active site. The enzyme was dependent on manganese, which is bound to the
active site, most efficiently cleaved single-stranded RNA substrates, did not cleave DNA,
and could be inhibited by known endonuclease inhibitors. The atomic structure in conjunc-
tion with stability and activity data for the 13 mutant enzymes facilitated inference of struc-
ture–function relationships in the protein. In conclusion, we solved the structure of a
hantavirus cap-snatching endonuclease, elucidated its catalytic properties, and present a
highly active mutant form, which allows for inhibitor screening.

Author Summary
Hantaviruses may cause severe disease in humans, either hemorrhagic fever or cardiopul-
monary syndrome. Both conditions are associated with high lethality. Vaccines and effec-
tive treatments approved for application in humans are not available. The L protein plays
a central role in hantavirus replication and represents a key target for antiviral drug devel-
opment. However, the protein is difficult to study, as it can hardly be expressed in cells,
and therefore structure and function are largely unknown. We succeeded to express and
purify the N-terminal domain of ANDV, a South American hantavirus, in mutant forms.
The atomic structure of the domain was solved by X-ray crystallography. The structural
data in conjunction with our enzymatic activity data demonstrate that the N-terminal part
of ANDV L protein harbors an endonuclease that cleaves RNA, presumably to “steal” cap
structures from cellular mRNA for virus transcription. The investigation of a range of
mutant enzymes revealed the detailed role of amino acid residues within the endonuclease.
Importantly, using a known inhibitor of viral endonucleases we demonstrate the potential
of the ANDV enzyme as an antiviral target. The discovery of a highly active mutant form
of the endonuclease, which can be expressed at high level, will facilitate drug discovery
programs for hantaviruses.
Introduction
Andes virus (ANDV) belongs to the genus Hantavirus within the family Bunyaviridae. Hanta-
viruses can be pathogenic to humans and are distributed worldwide [1–3]. Their natural hosts
are various rodent species [4]. ANDV is endemic in Argentina and Chile and its main reservoir
host is the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (Oligoryzomys longicaudatus) [5]. The virus causes hanta-
virus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) that is associated with a case fatality of up to 40%.
Related HCPS-causing hantaviruses are found throughout the Americas. However, in contrast
to other hantaviruses, ANDV can be transmitted from human to human [6, 7].
The hantavirus genome consists of three RNA segments: L (large), M (medium), and S
(small) [8]. The L segment encodes the 250-kDa L protein, which contains an RNA-dependent
RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain in the center as indicated by sequence homology [9]. The L
protein is likely to possess additional enzymatic functions involved in transcription and repli-
cation of the RNA genome. The M segment contains the gene for the glycoprotein precursor,
which is cleaved co-translationally into the envelope proteins Gn and Gc. The S segment
encodes the nucleoprotein, which encapsidates the viral genome. Several hantaviruses encode a
second gene product in the S segment, the non-structural protein NSs. This small protein
seems to play a role in modulating the immune response of the host cell [10, 11].
The 5’ ends of hantavirus mRNAs contain a stretch of heterologous nucleotides suggesting
that the virus uses a mechanism called ‘cap-snatching’ to initiate transcription of its mRNAs
[12, 13]. Cap-snatching involves two steps. First, the 5’ end of a cellular mRNA is bound by a
viral cap-binding protein and secondly, the cap is cleaved off several nucleotides downstream
by a viral endonuclease. The capped RNA fragment is used as a primer to initiate transcription
of the viral mRNA by the RdRp. The viral strategy of stealing the 5’ cap from host cell mRNA
was first described for influenza A virus (IAV; family Orthomyxoviridae) [14]. Here, the cap-
binding and endonuclease domains reside in the PB2 and PA proteins, respectively [15–19]. In
other segmented negative strand RNA viruses, the endonuclease resides in the very N terminus
of the L protein, as shown for La Crosse virus (LACV; genus Orthobunyavirus, family Bunya-
viridae), Lassa virus, and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (both family Arenaviridae) [20–

23]. An endonuclease motif (H-PD-D/E-K) is also found in the N terminus of hantavirus L
proteins, although there is no experimental evidence for a functional enzyme. The endonucle-
ase is a potential target for antiviral therapy, as cap-snatching is an essential step in virus repli-
cation [24–35].
Investigation of L protein of ANDV and other hantaviruses has been challenging, because
the protein is difficult to express in heterologous systems [36, 37]. We have previously shown
that this phenotype is determined at post-transcriptional level and that mutations in the puta-
tive endonuclease can rescue L protein expression in mammalian cells [37]. Both suggests that
a strong catalytic activity of the ANDV endonuclease prevents high-level expression by down
regulating the level of its own and host cell mRNAs.
The aim of the current study was to provide proof for the existence of a cap-snatching endo-
nuclease in ANDV L protein using a structural and biochemical approach. We took advantage
of the previously characterized mutations enhancing the L protein level in mammalian cells to
facilitate expression of the endonuclease domain in bacteria.
Results
Expression and purification of ANDV endonuclease
For structural and biochemical characterization of the putative endonuclease of ANDV, we
aimed to express the N terminus of L protein in E. coli. To this end, plasmids for expression of
the N-terminal 163, 179, 191, 194, 197, 200, 211, 214, and 228 amino acid residues of wild-type
ANDV L protein were generated using E. coli cloning strain DH5α. To facilitate purification,
the expression constructs contained an N-terminal His-tag or His-tag plus maltose-binding
protein (MBP), respectively. However, we encountered difficulties in expressing the L protein
fragments in bacteria, as observed previously in mammalian cells [36, 37]. Proteins with less
than 200 residues were found exclusively in inclusion bodies. Transformation of expression
strains of E. coli with constructs containing 200 or more residues failed repeatedly, suggesting
that background expression of soluble wild-type endonuclease is already toxic to the cells. To
circumvent this problem, we took advantage of 15 amino acid exchanges that enhanced L pro-
tein expression in mammalian cells, presumably because they attenuate the enzymatic activity
of the endonuclease [37]. All 15 mutations were individually introduced into the plasmids for
expression of L protein amino acid residues 1–200 fused to an N-terminal His-tag (ANDV
L1–200) and the mutated constructs were tested for expression in E. coli BL21 cells. The results
are summarized in Table 1. Two mutants (L1–200 Y32V and D37A) showed a phenotype like
the wild-type protein, i.e. no bacterial growth was observed. The remaining 13 mutants (L1–200
R35H, H36R, D40E, I43A, K44A, N50A, P96A, D97E, N98A, E110A, K124A, K127A, and
N167A) were successfully expressed with varying yield and purified via nickel affinity and size
exclusion chromatography (S1 Fig). Noticeable slower growth of expressing E. coli was
observed for L1–200 N167A. A thermofluor assay [38] was used to evaluate the stability of the
mutant proteins under various conditions. The ANDV L1–200 mutants were most stable at high
salt concentrations and low pH (S2 Fig), as expected from their calculated isoelectric point of
approximately 7.5. Therefore, we used pH 5.5 and 1 M NaCl for protein purification. All
mutants eluted from the size exclusion column according to their molecular mass, indicating
they form monomers in solution.
ANDV endonuclease structure
ANDV L1–200 K127A was chosen for structural studies, as this mutant was the most stable
mutant, which retained the capacity to bind to manganese ions—a co-factor of nucleases—
along with a residual enzymatic activity (for details, see section on thermal stability below).

The mutant was expressed as His-tag fusion of variable lengths (200, 211, 214, and 228 L pro-
tein residues) and subjected to crystallization trials. We succeeded to crystallize ANDV L1–200
K127A in the presence of Mn2+
after cleavage of the His-tag. The crystal structure was solved
in space group P4212 by molecular replacement using coordinates for residues 32–162 from
the endonuclease of Hantaan virus ([39], co-submission), allowing for the building of a contig-
uous polypeptide chain for one molecule in the asymmetric unit and refinement to a resolution
of 2.4 Å (see S1 Table, 5HSB.pdb). Clear electron density was visible for the complete structure
with the exception of the loop between the first two α-helices (residues 13–20), where the signal
was weak. The structure clearly shows a Mn2+
ion bound to the active site (Fig 1A), as verified
by an anomalous signal from data collected at 1.77 Å.
The crystal structure of ANDV L1–200 K127A and the comparison to the cap-snatching
endonucleases of LACV, LCMV, and IAV [15, 19, 21–23] provides clear evidence for the N ter-
minus of ANDV L protein being an endonuclease (Fig 1B). ANDV L1–200 has an overall

structure similar to the other viral endonucleases with the highest similarity to its closest rela-
tive LACV. Considering the almost lacking sequence homology between the four proteins—
except the catalytic H-PD-D/E-K motif—the structural homology is surprisingly high: RMSD
values between the structural core (orange) of ANDV endonuclease and LACV, LCMV and
IAV endonucleases are 1.7 Å, 1.9 Å and 2.2 Å, respectively (as given by DALI [40]. The central
β-sheet with the long α-helix αd that runs parallel to the β-sheet forms the core of the protein
and provides the crucial active site residues in all four endonucleases (Fig 1A and 1B, shown in
orange). Further structural elements are helical, although number, length, as well as position of
the α-helices vary significantly between the structures. In all endonucleases, the active site is
located in a groove between two lobes. One lobe is formed by a helix bundle that consists of
two to three α-helices from the N terminus and at least one long α-helix (starting around resi-
due 160) from the C-terminal end of the domain (Fig 1A and 1B, shown in green). The interac-
tion between the last residues of the C-terminal helix and the first residues of the second helix
stabilizes the 3-helix bundle (αa, αb, αf) and provides a plausible explanation why constructs
with less than 200 residues were misfolded and thus insoluble. The other lobe contains less con-
served structural elements consisting of two to three small helices (Fig 1A and 1B, shown in
yellow). ANDV features a short additional α-helix αe between strand βc and the C-terminal
helix αf, which is not present in LACV (Fig 1C).
One of the obvious differences between the endonuclease of ANDV and the other viruses
are the overall dimensions of the domain: ANDV L1–200 is long and flat with approximate
outer dimensions of 70 Å × 45 Å × 30 Å, whereas the other structures are more compact, in

particular that of the distantly related IAV. The outer dimensions of the protein in the crystal
fit with the dimensions in solution as determined by small angle X-ray scattering, indicating
that the overall shape was not affected by crystallization artifacts (Figs 1D and S3).
Surface charge distribution of ANDV endonuclease
Most of the surface of ANDV L1–200 is formed by the helix bundle composed of the N- and C-
terminal helices αa+b and αe+f, and the three small helices αc, αc’ and αc” (Fig 1A and 1B).
These helices differ between the endonucleases not only in their conformation and orientation,
but also in their amino acid composition. Fig 2A shows how this leads to a significant alteration
in surface charge distribution compared to the other enzymes. The ANDV endonuclease has
large positively charged patches surrounding the active site groove, which are not or only to a
lesser extent present in LACV and LCMV or even replaced by negatively charged areas. The
more positively charged surface may increase the binding affinity of the enzyme to its substrate,
i.e. negatively charged mRNA.
Active site arrangement and ligand binding
A closer look at the active site of the ANDV endonuclease (Fig 2C) in comparison to LACV
and IAV demonstrates the structural similarity of the essential catalytic residues. The side
chains of the conserved H-PD-D/E-K motif superimpose well (Fig 2B). The manganese bound
to the active site also superimposes with one of the two metal ions present in the other struc-
tures. Sequence comparisons suggested that the active site of the ANDV endonuclease is more
closely related to IAV than LACV [20, 37]. Indeed, Lys124 of ANDV superimposes with
Lys134 of IAV, whereas LACV has a threonine at this position and the equivalent lysine
(Lys94) is provided by a different part of the protein.
Close to the active site, electron density for a sulfate and a glycerol molecule is visible in the
structure (Fig 2D). The glycerol ligand is coordinated by the conserved residues Tyr32 and
Arg35 (Fig 2E), both of which have previously been proposed to regulate the endonuclease
activity of the L protein [37].
Structure–function relationships in the ANDV endonuclease
With the crystal structure of the ANDV cap-snatching endonuclease at hand, we may infer a
more precise role for the 15 amino acid residues that have been implicated in the activity of the
endonuclease in mammalian cells [37] (Fig 3). The residues can be allocated to five different
groups according to their presumed role: (1) catalytic residues (His36, Asp97, and Glu110), (2)
active site residues not essential for activity (Asp37, Pro96, Lys124, and Lys127), (3) residues
involved in RNA binding in the vicinity of the active site (Tyr32 and Arg35), (4) residues form-
ing stabilizing contacts close to the active site (Asp40, Ile43, Lys44, Asn50, and Asn98), and (5)
residues stabilizing helix αe (Asn167). The hypothetical role also considers biochemical and
thermal stability data (Table 1 and sections below).
His36, Asp97, and Glu110 (group 1) are the central catalytic residues coordinating the man-
ganese ion (Figs 2C and 3). Asp37 and Pro96 (group 2) are relevant for positioning the catalytic
residues His36 and Asp97, respectively. Lys124 and Lys127 (group 2), which emerge from
helix αd, may position the RNA substrate in the active site. Tyr32 and Arg35 (group 3) are
located in helix αb and bind a glycerol solvent molecule in the structure. Their position at the
entrance of the catalytic site and capacity to bind hydroxyl groups let us to speculate that these
residues may also be involved in binding the negatively charged RNA substrate. Asp40, Lys44,
Asn50, and Asn98 (group 4) form hydrogen bonds with each other and main chain atoms to
stabilize and position the loop that contains the catalytic Asp97. Ile43 forms hydrophobic

interactions between the end of helix αb and several hydrophobic side chains both from the β-
sheet and from helix αe. Group 5 contains only Asn167. It is located in the small helix αe,
which is not present in the LACV endonuclease (Fig 1D) and stabilizes this helix via hydrogen
bonds with main chain atoms of strand βc.
Manganese binding and enzymatic activity of the ANDV endonuclease
The thermal stability of the purified proteins without and with manganese was measured by
thermofluor assay [38] in analogy to previously described experiments with the IAV and
LACV cap-snatching endonucleases [16, 20]. Melting temperature (Tm) as a measure of stabil-
ity varies from 34.2°C for the least stable L1–200 I43A mutant to 49.2°C for the most stable

L1–200 K124A mutant (Fig 4A and 4B). For most mutants, the Tm increased by approximately
7°C in the presence of 4 mM manganese, presumably due to binding of the metal in the cata-
lytic site. Consistent with this explanation, mutation of catalytic residues directly involved in
Fig 3. Structure–function relationships in the ANDV endonuclease. Based on the crystal structure of L1–200 K127A, a role for the
15 amino acid residues, that have been implicated in the activity of the endonuclease in mammalian cells [37], was inferred. Side

metal coordination (His36, Asp97, and Glu110) abolishes this stabilizing effect. Interestingly,
increasing the manganese concentration to 16 mM led to a substantial additional Tm increase
of up to 8°C for some mutants, suggesting binding of another metal ion by the active site (Fig
4A and 4B). In contrast to manganese, magnesium ions showed a much weaker effect (Fig 4A
and 4B).
Enzymatic activity was measured in a ribonuclease assay. A 5’-radioactively labeled 27mer
single stranded (ss) RNA molecule was used as substrate, and the level of activity was measured
by substrate degradation. None of the mutants was active in the absence of divalent ions. Addi-
tion of manganese rescued activity for some mutants (Fig 5A), while magnesium had no
enhancing effect at all. Therefore, all further assays were performed in the presence of manga-
nese. As expected, active site mutants L1–200 H36R, D97E, and E110A were inactive despite
addition of manganese (Fig 5A and 5B). Mutation of Arg35, Lys124, and Lys127, still allowed
for very low residual activity. Mutation of Asn50 and Pro96 stabilizing the active site loop also
strongly reduced endonuclease activity. Mutations affecting stability of the tertiary structure

(D40A, I43A, K44A, N98A, and N167A) allowed for intermediate to high activity. We could
not detect an intermediate cleavage product of specific length (S4 Fig). The most active mutant
was L1–200 N167A, which was therefore chosen for further biochemical experimentation. Ther-
mal stability and enzymatic activity data are summarized in Table 1.
Substrate preference of ANDV endonuclease
To investigate substrate specificity of the ANDV endonuclease, we used three mutants with a
range of enzymatic activity: L1–200 N167A with high activity, L1–200 K44A with intermediate
activity, and L1–200 D97E as a negative control. First, four different substrates were tested: a
27mer ssRNA that can form secondary structures (predicted hairpin Tm = 77°C), the same
sequence as double stranded (ds) RNA, and the corresponding ssDNA and dsDNA molecules
(Fig 5C). ANDV L1–200 N167A and K44A were most active on ssRNA, though they can also
less efficiently cleave dsRNA. None of the mutants was active on ssDNA or dsDNA, indicating
that the enzyme is a ribonuclease. Furthermore, we compared the ribonuclease activity on
ssRNA with different sequence, structure, and length (Fig 5D). Comparison of the 27mer RNA
with hairpin-like structure vs. a 27mer unstructured poly(A) RNA reveals preference for the

negative control (L1–200 D97E) did not show background degradation, demonstrating that our
purification procedure removes potentially contaminating bacterial nucleases.
Inhibition of ribonuclease activity
The metal-dependent cap-snatching endonuclease is an attractive target for antiviral drugs
against segmented negative strand RNA viruses and promising compounds have been
described for influenza [24–35]. To proof suitability of the ANDV endonuclease expressed in
this study for screening of potential inhibitors, we first measured the effect of the classical influ-
enza virus endonuclease inhibitor 2,4-dioxo-4-phenylbutanoic acid (DPBA) [33] on thermal
stability of ANDV L1–200 mutants H36R, K44A, N50A, D97E, E110A, K125A, K127A, and
N167A in the presence of 16 mM MnCl2. All mutants that showed a stabilization of > 8°C in
the presence of manganese, also showed a further increase in the melting temperature upon
addition of DPBA (Fig 6A), indicating that DPBA binds to and stabilizes the manganese–active
site complex. In agreement with this conclusion, mutation of residues His36, Asp97 and
Glu110, which are involved in coordination of at least one manganese ion, abolishes the stabi-
lizing effect of DPBA.
To prove that DPBA not just binds to the active site of ANDV L1–200, but also inhibits the
ribonuclease activity, we incubated the most active mutant ANDV L1–200 N167A with Mn2+
and DPBA for 15 min prior to the addition of the RNA substrate. Fig 6B and 6C show a clear
dose-dependent inhibition of the enzymatic activity comparable to IAV and LACV [16, 20].
Discussion
This study provides structural and biochemical evidence for the existence of an endonuclease in
the N terminus of ANDV L protein. In agreement with previous studies on expression of L pro-
tein in mammalian cells [36, 37], we have not been able to express the wild-type endonuclease
domain in bacterial cells. Therefore, we took advantage of a range of mutations to facilitate
expression of the domain. By using this approach, we expressed large amounts of various
mutants and eventually solved the crystal structure of the ANDV L1–200 K127A mutant. The first
structure of a hantavirus cap-snatching endonuclease reveals similarities to the related enzymes
from LACV, LCMV, and IAV [16, 18, 20–23]. Besides the active site residues the sequence is
hardly conserved. However there are obvious common structural features present: all cap-snatch-
ing endonucleases consist of two lobes with the conserved active site buried in a cavity in
between. However, compared to the other enzymes, ANDV has positively charged patches sur-
rounding the active site. The positively charged surface may increase the affinity of the enzyme
for negatively charged RNA substrates. Whether or not this feature plays a role in the apparently
strong endonuclease activity upon recombinant expression remains to be determined.
The structure in conjunction with the thermal stability and enzymatic activity data of the
attenuated mutants allow us to speculate on the contribution of individual residues for enzy-
matic activity, substrate binding, and overall stability of the tertiary structure (Table 1). The
data demonstrate that residues His36, Asp97, and Glu110 coordinate the manganese ion and
are essential for the catalytic process. All three residues act in a cooperative manner, as removal
of one residue is sufficient to prevent binding of both metal ions and inactivate the enzyme.
The two lysine residues at positions 124 and 127 in the active site may stabilize the attacking
hydroxide nucleophile during catalysis and/or bind to the RNA substrate, as speculated previ-
ously for IAV and LACV [16, 20]. Mutation of both lysines does not affect the stabilizing effect
of DPBA, suggesting they play no essential role in metal binding. The two residues Tyr32 and
Arg35, which coordinate a glycerol ligand in the crystal structure, may also be involved in sub-
strate binding. Arg35 seems to be of particular relevance, as it is conserved in all bunyavirus L

proteins and the L1–200 R35H mutant is largely defective, although it clearly binds manganese
in the thermal stability experiments. Tyr32 seems to be less important, as the L1–200 Y32V
mutant behaves like the wild-type protein and is toxic to E. coli cells.

Interestingly, several attenuating mutations (D40E, I43A, K44A, N50A, N98A, and N167A)
seem to slightly destabilize the protein, which might affect the enzymatic activity of the
enzyme. The corresponding wild-type residues are involved in hydrogen bonds with other side
or main chain atoms or in hydrophobic interactions with neighboring secondary structure ele-
ments. Consistent with the structural data, most of these mutants are characterized by low tem-
perature stability and high residual enzymatic activity. Residue Asn167 is exceptional as it is
located distant to the active site. Via hydrogen bonds with β-sheet βc it positions a small helix
(αe) that is not present in the otherwise similar LACV protein. Consistent with the peripheral
location of Asn167, the corresponding mutant is the least attenuated. Its wild-type like features
include the highest enzymatic activity and a reduced growth rate of the expressing E. coli cells.
Given the strong activity of an attenuated version of the enzyme on various RNA templates, it
is plausible that the wild-type enzyme activity is too toxic for high-level expression in pro- and
eukaryotic cells. Hantaviruses must have an intricate mechanism to control the activity of the
endonuclease in infected cells or to keep the concentration of the L protein at a sub-toxic level.
The biochemical data also revealed a clear co-factor and substrate specificity of the ANDV
endonuclease. Consistent with its presumed function as a cap-snatching enzyme, it preferred
ssRNA over dsRNA substrates and was inactive on ssDNA or dsDNA. RNA length and sec-
ondary structure seem to influence substrate binding. Dependence of enzymatic activity from
manganese rather than magnesium has also been observed for the endonucleases of the other
segmented negative strand viruses [16, 20, 21]. However, in contrast to LACV and IAV with
two metal ions in the active site [16, 20], the ANDV crystal structure contains only a single
manganese ion (equivalent to Mn1) [21], while the LCMV structure does not contain any ions
in the active site. The reason for this discrepancy may be explained by our crystallization condi-
tions and thermal stability data. At 2 mM manganese, the active site in the crystals contained a
single ion. However, we observed an additional increase in thermal stability when increasing
the manganese concentration from 4 mM to 16 mM, suggesting the binding of an additional
ion (equivalent to Mn2) at higher manganese concentration. This is in agreement with findings
by Reguera et al. 2016 [39] for related endonucleases showing a high binding affinity for the
first manganese ion (Mn1), but low affinity for the second manganese ion (Mn2). It is reason-
able to propose that ANDV and other hantaviruses share the same two-metal dependent cata-
lytic mechanism with LACV and IAV [16].
This study also has implications for development of antiviral drugs to treat hantavirus infec-
tions. The influenza virus endonuclease has been used as a target in antiviral drug discovery
programs and several specific inhibitors have been found [24–35]. Likewise, the ANDV endo-
nuclease is an attractive target for antiviral drug development. The experiments with the
known endonuclease inhibitor DPBA [33] provide proof-of-concept that the ribonuclease
activity of the enzyme is amenable to compound screening. The highly active ANDV L1–200
N167A mutant is the most promising enzyme candidate for this purpose.
Materials and Methods
Cloning, expression, and purification of the N-terminal domain of ANDV
L protein
The cDNA of fragments encoding residues 1–163, 1–179, 1–191, 1–194, 1–197, 1–200, 1–211,
1–214 and 1–228 from the L protein of ANDV (strain Chile 9717869, GenBank accession no.
AF291704) were amplified by PCR using the pCITE-ANDV-L plasmid [37] as a template.
Virus sequences were cloned into pOPIN-F (N-terminal His-tag–3C protease cleavage site)
and pOPIN-M (N-terminal His-tag–maltose binding protein–3C protease cleavage site) [41]. L
protein mutants (Y32V, R35H, H36R, D37A, D40E, I43A, K44A, N50A, P96A, D97E, N98A,

E110A, K124A, K127A and N167A) were generated via a classical two-step PCR mutagenesis
approach as described previously [42] and the resulting fragments cloned into pOPIN-F. For
cloning, E. coli strain DH5α was used. The sequence of the inserts was confirmed by
sequencing.
Proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21 Gold (DE3) (Novagen) at 17°C overnight
using LB medium and 0.5 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranosid for induction. Cells were
pelleted, resuspended in lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.3, 300 mM NaCl, 10
mM imidazole, 10% glycerol, 10 mM MnCl2, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluorid and dis-
rupted by sonication. The soluble material was loaded onto a Ni-NTA affinity column, washed
with 10 column volumes of lysis buffer containing 50 mM imidazole, and eluted with 5 vol-
umes of lysis buffer containing 500 mM imidazole. The His-tag of eluted protein was cleaved
off using glutathione S-transferase-tagged 3C protease at 4°C overnight during dialysis against
lysis buffer. The untagged proteins were further purified by size exclusion chromatography
using a Superdex 200 column in 50 mM sodium citrate pH 5.5, 1 M NaCl, 5% glycerol. Purified
proteins were concentrated using centrifugal devices, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored
in aliquots at –20°C.
Crystallization and structure determination
ANDV L1–200 K127A (10 mg/ml) was crystallized in the presence of 2 mM MnCl2, 100 mM
sodium acetate pH 5.0, 27.5% polyethylene glycol 3350, and 500 mM (NH4)2SO4 by sitting
drop vapor diffusion. Crystals were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen with 8% butanediol as cryo
protectant and diffraction data were collected to 2.4 Å at beamline ID23-1 at the European
Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, with a wavelength of 0.98 Å and 1.77 Å for respec-
tively native and anomalous data. Datasets were processed with iMosflm [43]. The crystal
structure was solved in space group P4212 by molecular replacement using residues 32–162
from the endonuclease from Hantaan virus [39] and PHASER [44], and refined by iterative
cycles of manual model building in Coot [45] and computational optimization with PHENIX
[46]. TLS refinement was performed during the final stages of refinement [47] with the entire
molecule as rigid group. Data collection and refinement statistics are shown in the crystallo-
graphic table in the supplemental information. Structural data were visualized with Pymol and
Chimera [48]. Electrostatic surfaces were calculated using PDB2PQR and APBS [49, 50]. The
coordinates have been deposited to the PDB (5HSB.pdb).
Small angle X-ray scattering
Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data for 1, 2, and 5 mg/ml of ANDV L1–200 K127A in 2
mM MnCl2, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.3, 250 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol were collected at the SAXS
beamline P12 at the PETRA III storage ring of the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron, Ham-
burg [51]. Using a PILATUS 2M pixel detector at 3.1 m sample distance and 10 keV energy
(λ = 1.24 Å), a momentum transfer range of 0.01 Å–1
< s < 0.45 Å–1
was covered (s = 4π sinθ/
λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle). Data were analyzed using the ATSAS 2.6 package [52]. The
forward scattering I(0) and the radius of gyration Rg were extracted from the Guinier approxi-
mation calculated with the AutoRG function within PRIMUS [53]. GNOM [54] provided the
pair distribution function P(r) of the particle and the maximum size Dmax. Ab initio recon-
structions were generated with the program DAMMIF [55]. Ten independent DAMMIF runs
were superimposed by SUPCOMB [56] and averaged using the program DAMAVER [55].

NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.25 U/μl RNasin (Promega) in the absence or presence of 2 mM MnCl2 at
37°C for 1 or 2 h. RNA was annealed by heating to 98°C for 2 minutes, followed by a slow cooling
over 2 hours to room temperature. A 27 or 40mer poly(A) ssRNA was used as unstructured sub-
strate. In selected experiments, 2,4-dioxo-4-phenylbutanoic acid (DPBA) was added to the assay.
The reaction was stopped by adding 2 × loading buffer (95% formamide, 18 mM ethylenediamine-
tetraacetic acid (EDTA), 0.025% sodium dodecyl sulfate, xylene cyanol, and bromophenol blue)
and heating the samples to 98°C for 5 min. The reaction products were separated by 8 M urea,
20% polyacrylamide, Tris-borate-EDTA gel electrophoresis and visualized by phosphor screen
autoradiography using a Typhoon scanner (GE Healthcare). Intensity of the signals was quantified
by ImageJ software [57].
Thermal stability assay
The stability of ANDV L1–200 protein was measured by thermofluor assay at a protein concen-
tration of 10 μM in 100 mM Tris pH 7.0, 250 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol complemented with either
10 mM EDTA, 4 mM MnCl2, 16 mM MnCl2, 16 mM MgCl2 or 16 mM MnCl2 plus 100 μM
DPBA as described [38].
