Abstract
Many viruses significantly impact human and animal health. Understanding the
population dynamics of these viruses and their hosts can provide important
insights for epidemiology and virus evolution. Puumala virus (PUUV) is a Euro-
pean hantavirus that may cause regional outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever with
renal syndrome in humans. Here, we analyzed the spatiotemporal dynamics of
PUUV circulating in local populations of its rodent reservoir host, the bank vole
(Myodes glareolus) during eight years. Phylogenetic and population genetic analy-
ses of all three genome segments of PUUV showed strong geographical structur-
ing at a very local scale. There was a high temporal turnover of virus strains in
the local bank vole populations, but several virus strains persisted through multi-
ple years. Phylodynamic analyses showed no significant changes in the local effec-
tive population sizes of PUUV, although vole numbers and virus prevalence
fluctuated widely. Microsatellite data demonstrated also a temporally persisting
subdivision between local vole populations, but these groups did not correspond
to the subdivision in the virus strains. We conclude that restricted transmission
between vole populations and genetic drift play important roles in shaping the
genetic structure and temporal dynamics of PUUV in its natural host which has
several implications for zoonotic risks of the human population.
Introduction
The evolution of pathogens is profoundly influenced by the
evolutionary history and geographical distribution of their
hosts. Connectivity between host populations and their
local sizes determine to a large extent the transmission and
infection rates and geographical distribution of a pathogen.
However, pathogens may evolve specific strategies or use
windows of opportunity to overcome the limitations of
particular host species, resulting in host-switch events and
the (re-)emergence of infectious diseases (e.g., malaria,
influenza, AIDS, and Ebola). Emerging infectious diseases
may thus be examples where pathogens escape the evolu-
tionary constraints of particular hosts and enter different
evolutionary backgrounds (Cox-Singh 2012; Morse et al.
2012).
The number of emerging infectious diseases is increasing,
and these pathogens have a profound impact on public and
animal health as well as on the economy (Jones et al.
2008). A large proportion of the emerging diseases repre-
sent zoonoses caused by RNA viruses that are transmitted
to humans from their natural reservoir species (Cleaveland
et al. 2001; Holmes 2009). Understanding the population
dynamics and interactions between viruses and their natu-
ral hosts is essential for resolving epidemiological processes
and their evolutionary trajectories (Gire et al. 2014).

Evolutionary Applications
Hantaviruses, segmented negative stranded RNA viruses
from the Bunyaviridae family, are among the most impor-
tant emerging infectious pathogens with often enigmatic
epidemiology and transmission pathways (Vaheri et al.
2013b). In the Americas, they are responsible for hantavi-
rus cardiopulmonary syndrome with relatively high case
fatality rate in humans. Hantaviruses in Asia, Europe, and
most likely also Africa can cause hemorrhagic fever with
renal syndrome (HFRS) (Vaheri et al. 2013a). The natural
hosts of hantaviruses are mostly small rodents (families
Muridae and Cricetidae), but also insectivores from the
order Soricomorpha (families Talpidae and Soricidae),
and bats (Guo et al. 2013; Schlegel et al. 2014). To date,
only hantaviruses harbored by rodents have been identi-
fied as pathogenic to humans. Transmission of the viruses
to humans occurs mainly through inhalation of virus-
contaminated aerosols of excreta from infected rodents
(Vaheri et al. 2013a).
Puumala virus (PUUV) is a hantavirus that causes a
mild to moderate form of HFRS in humans. The natural
reservoir host of PUUV is the bank vole, Myodes glareolus,
a small rodent species that occupies forested and wooded
areas throughout most of Europe. PUUV causes a chronic
infection in bank voles and may somewhat reduce survival
particularly in winter (Kallio et al. 2007; Tersago et al.
2012). The prevalence of PUUV in bank vole populations
ranges from absent to very high depending on the region
of Europe, the local population, and the year (Razzauti
et al. 2013). It has been suggested that PUUV outbreaks in
humans are associated with high densities of bank voles
caused by high tree seed production in the preceding year,
but there is considerable geographical variation in these
associations (Olsson et al. 2003; Kallio et al. 2009; Tersago
et al. 2009, 2011).
Phylogenetic analyses of PUUV typically detect differ-
ences between sequences even at relatively small geographi-
cal distances (Escutenaire et al. 2001; Sironen et al. 2002;
Razzauti et al. 2008; Mertens et al. 2011). This may be
explained by the very high evolutionary rates of these RNA
viruses, leading to divergent strains at different localities
over short periods and/or the lack of effective transmission
between bank vole populations. In central Europe, bank
voles belong generally to the same phylogeographic lineage
with no or very little substructure in mitochondrial DNA
(W
ojcik et al. 2010; Mertens et al. 2011). Autosomal mark-
ers can resolve population structures in bank voles at larger
geographical scales (White et al. 2013), but populations
may undergo very specific processes at the local level, for
example, source–sink dynamics (Guivier et al. 2011) per-
turbing spatial patterns. Investigations directly linking the
genetic structure of host populations with the genetic struc-
ture and molecular diversity of PUUV (or any other hanta-
virus) populations are lacking to date.
In this study, the following hypotheses were investigated:
(i) Genetic substructure in Puumala virus populations
reflects potential substructure in the host; (ii) the PUUV
strains in local rodent populations change rapidly through
time due to their high evolutionary rates and/or genetic
drift; and (iii) temporal dynamics of PUUV in natural
hosts and in human populations are related. To test these
hypotheses, we combine population genetic analyses of
PUUV and its natural host in an endemic area in central
Europe. Molecular data from bank vole populations col-
lected over eight years spanning several disease outbreaks
in human populations in the region together with sequence
information from all three segments of the virus genome
provide in unprecedented detail insight into the processes
of PUUV persistence and microevolution in its natural
rodent host. Such information is pivotal for the establish-
ment of targeted risk assessment and prevention measures
for the human population particularly in PUUV endemic
areas.
Materials and methods
Ethics statement
Rodent trapping was performed by the Lower Saxony State
Office for Consumer Protection and Food Safety (JF) as
part of the pest control measures against bank voles imple-
mented and authorized by the health authorities of the dis-
trict Osnabr€
uck (https://www.landkreis-osnabrueck.de/
veterinaer-gesundheit/infektionsschutz/mrsa) according to
German federal law (§ 18, Gesetz zur Verh€
utung und
Bek€
ampfung von Infektionskrankheiten beim Menschen).
These measures were implemented after ethical review by
the commission for infection protection of the district Os-
nabr€
uck after repeated hantavirus infections in the human
population in the district following the recommendations
of the Robert Koch-Institut for disease control
(www.rki.de; latest version: 10/2010).
Sampling procedure and sample preservation
Beginning in 2005, voles were trapped in a PUUV endemic
area using mouse snap traps baited with raisins as part of a
pest control and wildlife disease monitoring program. The
five trapping sites in the district Osnabr€
uck in northwest-
ern Germany (Fig. 1) can be characterized as broad-leaved
forests dominated by the common beech (Fagus sylvatica)
with scarce to no understory. After trapping, bank voles
were immediately frozen. Carcasses were thawed overnight,
and lungs and hearts were sampled under biosafety level 3
conditions. Chest cavity fluid (CCF) was collected by wash-
ing the chest cavity with 1 mL phosphate-buffered saline
(Essbauer et al. 2006; Mertens et al. 2011), and samples
were stored at 20°C until investigation.

Serology, hantavirus RT-PCR, and sequencing
Serological screening of CCF was performed by IgG ELISA
using yeast-expressed PUUV Vranica/H€
alln€
as and Bavaria
nucleocapsid proteins (Essbauer et al. 2006; Mertens et al.
2011). RNA was extracted from lung and heart tissue using
Qiazol solution (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The genome of
PUUV consists of three segments, small (S), medium (M),
and large (L), which encode the nucleocapsid protein, two
surface glycoproteins, and a viral RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase, respectively. An initial screening RT-PCR tar-
geting the S segment was performed using a One Step pro-
tocol as described in Essbauer et al. (2006). The screening
was repeated with modified primers (Table S1) for samples
that were negative in the initial screen. Finally, a nested
PCR protocol was used for the remaining negative samples
(Essbauer et al. 2006). For S segment-positive samples, M-
and L-segment-specific RT-PCRs were performed (Pilaski
et al. 1994; Klempa et al. 2006; Mertens et al. 2011). For
sequencing, amplicons were purified using QIAquick PCR
purification kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Qiagen). The products were sequenced at least three times
using the BigDye terminator sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer,
Waltham, MA, USA) on an ABI 310 Genetic Analyzer
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
PUUV population structure and phylogenetic
relationships
PUUV sequences were aligned manually using BioEdit
7.1.9 (Hall 1999). DnaSP version 5 (Librado and Rozas
2009) was used to determine the number of synonymous
and nonsynonymous substitutions and to estimate nucleo-
tide diversity in the PUUV sequences. Median-joining net-
works were produced with Network 4.6 (Bandelt et al.
1999), and genetic population structure was inferred with
an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) implemented in
Arlequin 3.5 (Excoffier and Lischer 2010). Pairwise FST val-
ues were calculated for each PUUV segment separately and
also for the three segments concatenated with 10 000 per-
mutations to assess the level of statistical significance. BaTS
(Parker et al. 2008) was used to determine the association
between the phylogeny and the geographical location of the
samples, by estimating the association index (AI), the parsi-
mony score (PS) and the maximum clade (MC) size statis-
tics. We tested for recombination and reassortment
between the PUUV segments with RDP4 (Martin et al.
2010) analogous to the analyses in Fink et al. (2010).
Phylogenetic analyses were performed with the concate-
nated segments including four published PUUV sequences
from the sampling sites (S segment: schle_05_001,
varus_09_024, astrup_07_003; M segment: schle_05_015)
and prototype strain Sotkamo as outgroup (accession num-
bers NC_005224, NC_005223, and NC_005225 for S, M,
and L segments, respectively). Mega 5.1 (Tamura et al.
2011) was used to reconstruct phylogenetic trees based on
neighbor-joining (NJ) algorithms. The HKY+G substitu-
tion model showed the best fit to our data based on the
Bayesian Information Criterion tested in jModelTest 2.13
(Darriba et al. 2012). Bayesian phylogenetic analyses were
performed with BEAST 1.7.5 (Drummond et al. 2012) on
the Cipres portal (Miller et al. 2010). After initial tests, we
used a strict molecular clock, a coalescent Bayesian skyline
tree prior with 10 groups, and otherwise default priors for
two runs of 100 million generations each with sampling
every 20 000 generations. A burn-in of 10% was discarded,
and convergence of model parameters was checked with
Tracer 1.5 (Rambaut and Drummond 2007). The runs were
combined using LogCombiner 1.7.5 (Drummond et al.
2012). A maximum clade credibility tree was produced
with TreeAnnotator 1.7.5 and visualized in FigTree 1.4.0
(http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).
PUUV Bayesian skyline plot analyses
BEAST2 (Bouckaert et al. 2014) was used to shed light on
the viral population dynamics. Bayesian skyline plot analy-
sis (Drummond et al. 2005) was performed to estimate the
effective population size and the substitution rate of PUUV
based on the Schledehausen and Astrup datasets without
the outgroup sequence. The two datasets were analyzed
jointly, enabling the estimation of a common substitution
rate. All other parameters, including the phylogenies, were
estimated separately. The BEAST specifications remained

as described above. The Bayesian skyline plots were drawn
with Tracer. Path-O-Gen (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/

against the sampling date, in order to confirm the presence
of temporal signal in the dataset.
Bank vole multilocus genotyping
Genomic DNA was extracted from tail tissue using the
phenol–chloroform method. The following 17 microsatellite
loci were amplified in three sets, using the Qiagen Multiplex
Kit in a PTC-100TM (MJ Research) thermocycler: CG1E6,
CG1E8, CG2A4, CG5F6, CG5G6, CG6D10, CG7C9,
CG12A7, CG12B9, CG13F9, CG13G2, CG15F7, CG16E2,
CG16E5, CG17E9 (Rikalainen et al. 2008), MSCg-15 and
MSCg-19 (Gockel et al. 1997). The amplification conditions
were 95°C for 15 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation
at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 57°C for 90 s and extension
at 72°C for 60 s, and 60°C for 30 min. Fragment separation
was performed on an ABI 3130 sequencer. Fragment length
was determined in comparison with the internal LIZ 500
size standard using GeneMapper 3.7 (Applied Biosystems).
Repetitions of previously scored genotypes were performed
to ensure genotyping consistency (Hahne et al. 2011).
Vole population structure
Each vole sampling locality was checked for the presence of
null alleles with MicroChecker 2.2 (Van Oosterhout et al.
2004). Deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
(HWE) were tested per population with Arlequin 3.5 (Ex-
coffier and Lischer 2010). Pairwise FST between populations
was computed as for the PUUV populations. We tested also
for significant genetic changes in the bank vole populations
over time, computing pairwise FST between samples from
different years for the localities Schledehausen and Astrup,
for which the largest sample sizes were available. Popula-
tion structure in the voles was analyzed further with the
clustering algorithm in Structure 2.3 (Pritchard et al.
2000), assuming an admixture model with correlated allele
frequencies (Falush et al. 2003) and without information
about the sampling population. We performed ten runs
each for K between one and ten with 400 000 Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) iterations and a burn-in of
40 000 iterations. The estimation of K followed the method
suggested by Evanno et al. (2005), and the figures were dis-
played with Distruct 1.1 (Rosenberg 2004).
Results
Detection and genetic diversity of PUUV
We sampled 319 bank voles between 2005 and 2012 at five
different localities with geographical distances between 2.5
and 17 km (Fig. 1, Table 1). PUUV-specific antibodies
were detected in 128 voles (41%) by ELISA, and in three
additional ones, PUUV RNA was detected only by RT-PCR
(infected animals: total 131; 42%). There were large differ-
ences in the prevalence between bank vole populations and
sampling years, ranging from 0% to 100% for localities
with at least ten voles trapped per year and a maximum of
89% PUUV-infected voles (n = 47) across all localities
in 2010 (Table 1, Fig. 2). Fluctuations in PUUV prevalence
in the voles coincided only to some extent with the changes
in the number of reported human infections in the
Osnabr€
uck district to which the localities belong adminis-
tratively. Also the number of human infections reported in
the German federal states Niedersachsen and Nordrhein-
Westfalen encompassing the study district showed no
strong association with local PUUV prevalence. For exam-
ple, in 2007, human infections were frequently reported in
the region (Fig. 2), but PUUV prevalence was only moder-
ate (19%) in the large number of voles sampled (n = 113).
Our sequences from the three PUUV segments S (637
nt), M (571 nt), and L (336 nt) cover in total about 13% of
the entire genome. There was no indication of double peaks
in the sequences potentially stemming from double infec-
tions or quasi-species. Nucleotide diversity per site varied
from 0.0124 for the S, over 0.0162 for the M to 0.0196 for
the L segment. There was a high diversity of virus
sequences with 13 different types for the S segment, 20 for
the M segment, 10 for the L segment, and 35 when all three
segments were concatenated. Twenty-three synonymous
and two nonsynonymous substitutions were found in the S
segment, 30 synonymous and seven nonsynonymous sub-
stitutions in the M segment, and 16 synonymous and five
nonsynonymous substitutions in the L segment. The high-
est number of substitutions between two sequence types
was 16, 23, and 14 for the S, M, and L segments, respec-
tively. Analyses with RDP4 (Martin et al. 2010) provided
neither evidence of recombination between genome seg-
ments (=reassortment) nor of recombination within seg-
ments (all P > 0.05).
Virus–geography relationships
PUUV populations from different localities were highly dif-
ferentiated. For the concatenated virus sequences, overall
population differentiation between localities was very high
with FST = 0.25 (P < 0.001), a pattern mirrored in the seg-
ment-specific analyses (S: FST = 0.44; M: FST = 0.50; L:
FST = 0.71; all P < 0.001). Pairwise FST values between
populations ranged between 0.18 and 0.36 (all P ≤ 0.0011,
except for the comparisons with Bramsche Tower; PUUV
n = 1; Table S2). Again, the results of analyses of single seg-
ments matched the concatenated dataset with only slight
quantitative and no qualitative differences (details not

shown). Pairwise FST values for the PUUV samples from
the same locality but from different years were also very
high, but they were significantly different from zero only
for some of the comparisons at the two localities with the
largest population samples (Schledehausen and Astrup;
Table S3). Association index and parsimony score from
analyses with BaTS also confirmed the geographical cluster-
ing of PUUV sequences (P < 0.001), and maximum clade
statistics revealed significant clustering in the sampling sites
of Astrup, Ellerbeck, Schledehausen and Bramsche Varus
(P < 0.01).
In the haplotype network analyses, virus sequences
always formed three clusters in the networks, each consist-
ing of samples from the same localities—irrespective of the
genome segment analyzed (Fig. 3). The first cluster con-
tains Schledehausen sequences only, the second cluster con-
sists of Bramsche Tower and Bramsche Varus, and the
third cluster is a composite of all sequences from Astrup
and Ellerbeck. For each genome segment, at least one
sequence type was shared between the Astrup and Ellerbeck
localities, and even after concatenation of the segments
resulting in 1544 nt, there was one sequence type that was
found in several voles at both localities (Astrup n = 7; El-
lerbeck n = 4, details not shown). In general, each geo-
graphical cluster contained one or two abundant sequence
types and several closely connected rare ones, which differ
from the abundant ones by one or two nonsynonymous
substitutions at maximum (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the num-
ber of substitutions separating the Astrup/Ellerbeck and
Schledehausen sequences (geographical distance approx.
3 km) is largest for all segments, and viruses from the geo-
graphically distant Bramsche sampling sites (approx.
14 km distance) were genetically distinct but more similar
to Schledehausen than to Astrup/Ellerbeck sequences.
Consistent with the networks, neighbor-joining and
Bayesian phylogenetic analyses recovered the same three
clusters in the concatenated sequences with very high sup-
port values (Fig. 4, Figure S1). Also in these phylogenies, the

Weber de Melo et al. Population dynamics of Puumala virus and its host
Schledehausen and Bramsche virus clades were closer related
to each other than to the clade that joined the PUUV
sequences from the Astrup and Ellerbeck populations.
Persistence of PUUV types through time
A high turnover of virus types between years was detected
in each vole population (Fig. 5, Figure S2), yet a few virus
sequence types persisted during the eight years of the study
even for the most variable M segment, despite the high evo-
lutionary rate of hantaviruses. In our largest single-location
sample, the Schledehausen population, three M segment
sequence types persisted through multiple years—two of
them for at least five years (Fig. 5). For the S and L seg-
ments, the common sequence types generally persisted
across multiple years although they were not always sam-
pled. Even for the concatenated sequences with the highest
resolution but the lowest sample size (n = 53), two types
were repeatedly found in the vole population at Schlede-
hausen in at least four different years. Novel PUUV
sequences containing nonsynonymous changes were
repeatedly detected in this vole population, but only one of
them was detected in multiple years and none of them rose
to high frequency (Fig. 5). The Astrup population with
appropriate samples sizes for these analyses (n = 43) pre-
sented very similar patterns of persistence of sequence types
during multiple years (Figure S2).
Population dynamics of PUUV
Bayesian skyline plot analyses provided no evidence of sig-
nificant changes in the effective population sizes of the
Schledehausen and Astrup populations during the eight
years of our study (Fig. 6), despite large fluctuations in
virus strain numbers and prevalence (Table 1, Fig. 2). For
both populations, the 95% highest posterior density (HPD)
intervals were relatively wide, and there was no obvious
relationship between virus sample sizes and effective popu-
lation size, consistent with the persistence of relatively few
virus types over time. However, the large 95% HPD inter-
vals suggest that the data do not contain enough informa-
tion to estimate the effective population size very precisely.
Analyses with Path-O-Gen revealed a significant correlation
between root-to-tip tree distances and sampling time, con-
firming the suitability of this dataset for estimating substi-
tution rates of PUUV. The median substitution rate of
PUUV was estimated as 2.70 9 10 4
substitutions/site/
year (95% HPD, 1.43 9 10 4
–4.38 9 10 4
).
Genetic diversity of bank voles
The bank vole microsatellite loci presented between three
and 47 alleles per locus and population, with expected het-
erozygosities ranging from 0.50 to 0.95 and observed het-
erozygosities from 0.24 to 1. Significant deviations from
HWE were found at nine different loci in population-wise
analyses, but this pattern was only consistent across the dif-
ferent populations for three loci. For these, we also detected
the likely presence of null alleles with estimated frequencies
of up to 0.37. However, performing all further analyses of

tances. Overall population differentiation was relatively
low but statistically significant (FST = 0.027; P < 0.001),
and also all pairwise comparisons among the sampling
localities were significantly different from zero (FST
between 0.014 and 0.047; all P < 0.001; Table S4). Clus-
tering analyses with Structure applying the decision rule
of Evanno et al. (2005) for the most likely K indicated
the existence of two major genetic clusters in all voles
sampled (Fig. 7). The vast majority of individuals from
Schledehausen were assigned to one cluster, and almost
all voles from the other four sites were likely to belong
to the second cluster.
The membership coefficients (q) of the individuals for
the clusters showed very little variation across the ten
Structure runs with K = 2, with an average standard devia-
tion of 0.0012 (maximum 0.011). PUUV-infected individu-
als with q < 0.9 for the local population (n = 28) were
always infected with a strain from the local virus cluster,
indicating that PUUV transmission must have occurred
locally if any of these voles were immigrants.
The inferred population structures of PUUV and bank
voles did not completely correspond (Fig. 7). The main
subdivision in the bank voles separated Schledehausen
from all other populations, which is in contrast to the

topology of subdivision in PUUV populations. We per-
formed additional Structure analyses with K = 3, which
could potentially match the level of subdivision in PUUV
(note that K = 3 had a lower likelihood than K = 2). The
forced separation of the bank voles into three genetic clus-
ters still did not match the subdivisions in the viruses, as
individuals from Schledehausen were mostly assigned to
one cluster, the majority of voles from Astrup to a second
cluster, and some individuals from Ellerbeck were assigned
to the Astrup cluster but most joined the third cluster with
Bramsche genotypes (Fig. 7).
Discussion
This study provides a first comprehensive investigation of
the spatial and temporal dynamics of PUUV in local popu-
lations together with its specific reservoir host. We
detected genetic subdivisions in the bank vole and the
PUUV populations at a very small geographical scale, but
the genetic breaks were neither directly associated between
host and virus, nor with geographical distances. Our per-
sistence analyses revealed high turnover rates but also the
presence of several virus types in the populations during
multiple years of the study. PUUV prevalence in local vole
populations and the incidence of human infections in the
larger area did not follow tightly correlated temporal
dynamics.
Vole and PUUV population structure
The fragmented and often very region-specific PUUV out-
breaks in central Europe have triggered a series of hypothe-
ses about the transmission mechanisms of PUUV and the
interactions with bank vole ecology and population
dynamics (Schwarz et al. 2009; Tersago et al. 2009). Phy-
logeographic analyses of bank vole mtDNA have shown the
presence of a single evolutionary lineage in most of Ger-
many without finer geographical patterns within (W
ojcik
et al. 2010; Mertens et al. 2011). Some population-based
analyses have resolved genetic structuring of bank voles at
larger geographical scales (Rikalainen et al. 2012; White
et al. 2013). The extent of genetic differentiation between

Weber de Melo et al. Population dynamics of Puumala virus and its host
the vole populations analyzed here was low but notable
given the very short distances between the localities. There
are no obvious barriers to dispersal such as rivers or major
roads which might restrict gene flow specifically (Gerlach
and Musolf 2000; Landguth et al. 2010 for general consid-
erations), maybe except for the Schledehausen village, situ-
ated partially between the Schledehausen, Astrup, and
Ellerbeck sites (Fig. 1). To examine whether the separation
of the Schledehausen population could go back to much
earlier events, we analyzed the mitochondrial D-loop
region of several samples from each of the vole populations
but detected only very low genetic variation and no evi-
dence of differentiation between the populations (results
not shown; for methods, see Heckel et al. 2005; Mertens
et al. 2011).
Higher genetic differentiation between the PUUV popu-
lations compared to the voles is consistent with the high
evolutionary rates in these RNA viruses (Ramsden et al.

2014) and a lower effective size of their haploid genomes
compared to the diploid hosts (Charlesworth 2009). No
other study has specifically tested for population structure
in PUUV, but a series of investigations detected the pres-
ence of different virus types at different localities (Sironen
et al. 2001; Johansson et al. 2008; Razzauti et al. 2009).
Beyond that, few studies have directly connected the inves-
tigation of genetic population structures in natural hosts
and fast evolving viruses. For example, Torres-P
erez et al.
(2011) found slightly more phylogeographic structure
across Chile in Andes hantavirus than in its rodent host.
Biek et al. (2006) showed much weaker structuring in
North American cougars than in the feline immunodefi-
ciency viruses carried by them. Thus, stronger genetic
structuring among populations of fast evolving viruses than
in their hosts may be more frequent in terrestrial systems
but may not extend to systems with highly mobile hosts or
vectors (Spackman et al. 2005; Chen and Holmes 2009; Liu
et al. 2011, 2012). In our system, the mismatch between
the deepest levels of host and virus population structure
(Fig. 7) may be related to, for example, a recent local
replacement by a more divergent PUUV strain, but it will
be necessary to extend our sampling to a wider area to test
such a demographic scenario specifically.
It is unclear to which extent selection may contribute to
differences between the virus populations, but the local
scale of our analyses makes the contribution of ecological
factors (e.g., habitat differences) rather unlikely. Differ-
ences between the bank voles as the actual environment in
which PUUV replicates cannot be excluded given signifi-
cant population structure, but nonsynonymous differences
between the major geographical clades were not larger than
variation within them (Fig. 3). In additional consideration
of the low population sizes of bank voles in some periods
(Fig. 2), genetic drift is thus likely to contribute strongly to
differentiation between PUUV populations at the
geographical scale investigated here.
Temporal dynamics of PUUV
Our results demonstrate high PUUV turnover in local
bank vole populations but also the persistence of some
common sequence types through several years. The geo-
graphically consistent clustering of PUUV sequences
(Fig. 3) suggests that de novo mutations are a more likely
source of the new and often transient sequence types
than transmission from vole immigrants. Potential immi-
grants, that is, infected voles with assignment values <0.9
in the Structure analyses, always carried a PUUV type
found at the site where they were trapped. Our sampling
scheme is not suitable to examine vole dispersal patterns
properly (see discussion in Schweizer et al. 2007), but if
some of these individuals were immigrants, infection
must have happened in all cases after the individual
entered the local population.
The high evolutionary rates of PUUV support also a con-
tribution of de novo generated variation to local strain
diversity over the course of the study. Based on our substi-
tution rate estimates and the concordant ones from Rams-
den et al. (2008; but see Plyusnin and Sironen 2014; Zhang
and Holmes 2014), we would expect on average about one
new substitution per sequenced fragment over the eight
years of the study. As mutation and substitution rate esti-
mates may differ strongly between different study systems
and show large variation across the genome (Sironen et al.
2001; Nemirov et al. 2010; Plyusnin and Sironen 2014;
Zhang and Holmes 2014; Sheikh Ali et al. 2015), a more
precise estimation of the contribution of de novo variation
to temporal variation in PUUV population diversity will
have to await dedicated analyses.
Rapid temporal turnover in RNA viruses is often seen as
a consequence of their high evolutionary rates and fast
response to selection (Holmes 2009; Łuksza and L€
assig
2014). Fitness differences between strains have been sug-
gested for PUUV (Sironen et al. 2008) and other viruses
(Bull and Molineux 2008; Alto et al. 2013), yet our phylo-
genetic analyses did not reveal the temporal clustering
often seen in other RNA viruses [e.g., influenza A virus
(Łuksza and L€
assig 2014); dengue virus (Twiddy et al.
2002; Bennett et al. 2003)]. Such a topology is normally
caused by strong selection in which only very few strains
with higher fitness give rise to new strains in the next time
period. The absence of such topologies here (see Fig. 4B,C
and Figure S1) may suggest that a period of eight years is
not long enough in PUUV evolution and/or that selection
was not sufficiently strong. Indeed, PUUV is often seen as
causing only a minor reduction of the fitness of infected
reservoir hosts (but see Kallio et al. 2007; Vaheri et al.
2013b). However, given relatively low local effective popu-
lation sizes of PUUV (Fig. 6) associated with low popula-
tion sizes of bank voles in winter (Kallio et al. 2007), it is
parsimonious to assume an important role of genetic drift
for PUUV strains in natural populations, and thus, differ-
ences in persistence periods in the vole populations may
not be related to any fitness differences between strains.
Our analyses of partial PUUV genomes likely missed
genetic variation in these strains, but potential additional
standing variation or the accumulation of de novo muta-
tions in other genome regions of the persisting strains can-
not erase the global patterns of persistence detected here.
Obviously, full genome data combined with experimental
approaches would be favorable to assess fitness differences
between PUUV strains in detail. Additionally, a further
extended sampling of PUUV – over a longer period of time
and with multiple sampling times per year – would cer-

Weber de Melo et al. Population dynamics of Puumala virus and its host
tainly deepen our understanding of the viral population
dynamics in the future.
Reassortment often contributes to genetic variation in
RNA viruses with segmented genomes, for example, in
influenza virus (Nelson and Holmes 2007; Łuksza and
L€
assig 2014) and bluetongue virus (Coetzee et al. 2012).
Natural reassortants were described for the Sin Nombre
hantavirus (Henderson et al. 1995), and Razzauti et al.
(2013) reported 19% reassortant viruses in regional PUUV
populations in central Finland. In the present study, there
was no evidence of reassortment between the PUUV seg-
ments or for multiple infection of a vole. Virus strains in
our study populations are genetically closer to each other
than in some of the Finnish populations (Razzauti et al.
2013), which might reduce the probability of detecting re-
assortment events. The absence of any evidence of reassort-
ment in our German populations over eight years, though,
raises the question whether the frequency of multiple infec-
tions and/or reassortments differs between populations or
geographical regions stochastically or whether this is related
to environmental factors. At present, it appears that north-
ern European PUUV strains might have higher evolution-
ary potential than central European ones because
reassortment has been reported more often from northerly
regions (Plyusnin et al. 1997; Razzauti et al. 2008, 2013).
However, the more frequent use of sequence data in Fen-
noscandia may bias the reports of reassortants in the litera-
ture. Thus, it remains to be tested whether the evolutionary
avenues of PUUV in Europe might differ even more with
geography than previously anticipated.
Conclusion
This study provides a first bottom-up perspective of the
population dynamics of PUUV and its natural host, the
bank vole, at a very fine geographical scale. Our temporal
analyses indicate limited cofluctuation of PUUV prevalence
in local natural host populations or host abundance and
outbreaks in the surrounding human population (Fig. 2;
but see, Olsson et al. 2003; Kallio et al. 2009; Tersago et al.
2009, 2011). The marked substructure among PUUV from
different localities, together with the high level of variability
and the appearance and disappearance of apparently only
slightly different sequence types in local vole populations,
offers the opportunity to develop strain distribution maps.
PUUV sequence information from human infections could
then be used to identify at a relatively fine scale the geo-
graphical region where and potentially under which cir-
cumstances the transmission of the virus to the patient
occurred. Coupling investigations of natural host popula-
tions with molecular data from human patients would thus
open new possibilities for an epidemiological understand-
ing of PUUV, and potentially for ‘uncovering the mysteries
of hantavirus infections’ (Vaheri et al. 2013b) in general.
