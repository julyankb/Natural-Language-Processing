Abstract
Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed a global health strategy
to eliminate viral hepatitis. We project the treatment and prevention requirements to achieve
the WHO HCV elimination target of reducing HCV incidence by 80% and HCV-related mortality by 65% by 2030 in Pakistan, which has the second largest HCV burden worldwide.
Methods: We developed an HCV transmission model for Pakistan, and calibrated it to
epidemiological data from a national survey (2007), surveys among people who inject
drugs (PWID), and blood donor data. Current treatment coverage data came from expert
opinion and published reports. The model projected the HCV burden, including incidence, prevalence and deaths through 2030, and estimated the impact of varying prevention and direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment interventions necessary for achieving the
WHO HCV elimination targets.
Results: With no further treatment (currently 150 000 treated annually) during 2016–30,
chronic HCV prevalence will increase from 3.9% to 5.1%, estimated annual incident infections will increase from 700 000 to 1 100 000, and 1 400 000 HCV-associated deaths will
occur. To reach the WHO HCV elimination targets by 2030, 880 000 annual DAA treatments are required if prevention is not scaled up and no treatment prioritization occurs.
By targeting treatment toward persons with cirrhosis (80% treated annually) and PWIDs
(double the treatment rate of non-PWIDs), the required annual treatment number

decreases to 750 000. If prevention activities also halve transmission risk, this treatment
number reduces to 525 000 annually.

Key Messages
• Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a global health problem, with 71 million people actively infected worldwide in 2015 and

80% of the global burden being concentrated in lower-middle income countries (LMIC).
• Following the advent of new highly effective treatments for HCV, the World Health Organization (WHO) has de-

veloped a global health strategy to eliminate viral hepatitis, with aims to reduce HCV incidence by 80% and mortality
by 65% by 2030.
• Pakistan is an LMIC which harbours 10% of the global HCV burden (7.0 million chronic infections in 2013).
• To achieve the WHO HCV elimination targets in Pakistan, model projections suggest substantial scale-up in treatment

is required (up to 880 000 treatments per year), although this can be minimized (to 525 000 per year) through scaling
up prevention interventions and targeting treatment to people with cirrhosis and people who inject drugs.
• This modelling study provides the first full estimation of the treatment and prevention requirements for achieving the

WHO HCV elimination targets.

Introduction
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major global health
problem, with an estimated 71 million chronic infections
worldwide and approximately 400 000 annual HCVrelated deaths in 2015.1,2 Globally, 80% of the HCV burden is concentrated in low and middle-income countries
(LMICs).3 New direct-acting antiviral (DAA) HCV treatments are all oral, well tolerated and achieve cure rates of
over 90%.4 The advent of these new treatments has played
an important role in the World Health Organization
(WHO) recently adopting a global health sector strategy
for eliminating viral hepatitis. This strategy commits countries to aggressive targets for eliminating viral hepatitis as a
public health threat. For HCV, the targets include an 80%
reduction in incident infections and 65% reduction in
HCV-associated mortality by 2030.5
Pakistan has the second largest HCV burden in the
world,1 with transmission being driven by multiple risk factors including community (barbering, ear/nose piercing)
and health care practices (blood transfusion, medical injections) and injecting drug use.6–8 A national survey from
2007 reported that 4.8% of the population, or nearly 8 million individuals, had been exposed to HCV at that time.7
More recent estimates suggest that 7.0 million persons were
chronically infected in 2013,1 meaning that Pakistan harbours one-tenth of the global burden of HCV. This

emphasizes the crucial importance of tackling the HCV epidemic in Pakistan, for any global effort to eliminate HCV.
Since 2005, the Pakistan government has launched national
and provincial hepatitis prevention and control programmes, including screening and treatment for HCVinfected individuals.7,9 Further local initiatives have focused
on educational interventions for HCV prevention.10 Data
are lacking on the effectiveness of these interventions.
To achieve the WHO HCV elimination targets, it is critical to gain an understanding of what is required to control
the generalized HCV epidemics in LMICs, something no
study has fully undertaken so far. Most previous models
considering generalized HCV epidemics in LMICs11–15
have solely evaluated the required level of HCV treatment
for achieving the WHO targets for reducing mortality.
These models do not incorporate the infectious disease aspect of HCV, and so were unable to project what is needed
to reduce HCV incidence. Only two models, both for
Egypt,16,17 have evaluated what treatment is needed to reduce incidence, but neither considered impact on mortality. The omissions of these models are important
weaknesses, because different treatment strategies and targeting of patient groups will be needed to reduce mortality
or reduce incidence. It is therefore critical to consider both
outcomes concurrently, and to evaluate how treatment levels can be optimized between targeting people with

population, including stratification by gender and age, (b) medical and community risk factors that contribute to HCV transmission, and (c) the infection dynamics of the HCV epidemic with disease progression stages. High medical risk is defined as having either over 5 therapeutic injections in the
last year, history of blood transfusions, surgery, or haemodialysis, whereas high community risk is defined as ever barbering (males), ear/nose piercings (females), tattoo/acupuncture, or sharing smoking equipment.

heightened transmission risk or greater risk of experiencing
disease morbidity, which will be especially important in
resource-limited settings.
In this study, we develop a dynamic HCV transmission
model for the ongoing HCV epidemic in Pakistan, to determine the required level of HCV treatment needed for
achieving both WHO elimination targets for incidence and
mortality. Importantly, we consider how the required level
of treatment can be minimized through targeting treatment
to those with HCV-related disease or heightened transmission risk, and by scaling up prevention interventions.

Methods
Model formulation
We developed a deterministic HCV transmission model
(schematic in Figure 1). The model incorporates population demographics, population growth, HCV transmission
in the general population and among people who inject
drugs (PWID), natural history of HCV infection, and behavioural risk factors thought to drive HCV transmission.
We incorporated three age classes: Young (0–19 years),
Young Adult (20–29 years) and Adult (30þ years), with

International Journal of Epidemiology, 2018, Vol. 47, No. 2

additional stratification among Young Adults to incorporate injecting drug use. These subgroups were divided into
four risk strata of low and/or high medical and/or community risk. Individuals can either be susceptible to HCV infection or infected, with the model incorporating HCV
disease progression. The Supplementary Materials include
a detailed model description (available as Supplementary
data at IJE online).
Individuals enter the model in the Young category at a
birth rate incorporating population growth, and are initially low risk. Individuals transition through the three agecategories, with a small proportion of Young Adults
becoming PWID. Individuals also progress through the different medical and community risk strata that are associated with elevated transmission risk. Individuals experience
age-specific mortality, with PWID experiencing additional
drug-related mortality. Susceptible individuals become
HCV-infected at a per capita rate dependent on gender,
age, level of medical and/or community risk and prevalence
of infection. PWID have additional infection risk. Some
newly infected individuals spontaneously clear infection,
whereas the remainder become chronically infected. If untreated, chronic HCV infection persists and gradually progresses to cirrhosis and then end-stage liver disease (ESLD),
namely decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC), which are associated with heightened mortality.18
Individuals are HCV-treated at a time-varying rate,
whereupon they either achieve a sustained virological response (SVR: effective cure), or fail treatment and return to
being chronically infected. Following successful treatment,
individuals become susceptible to reinfection.18 We assume
SVR halts further disease progression for pre-cirrhotic individuals, and slows progression for those with cirrhosis.19

Model parameterisation and calibration
The model was parameterized using demographic, behavioural and HCV epidemiological data from Pakistan and
international databases (see Supplementary Materials and
Supplementary Tables S2 and S3 for details, available as
Supplementary data at IJE online). The model was fit to
demographic data for Pakistan from 2015 (population of
189–99 million), and changes in population size and
growth rates.20 Age-specific mortality rates were calibrated
to give the population age distribution in 2015. The model
was calibrated to the estimated proportion of individuals
that are PWID (0.24%) in 2013,21 and their estimated
HCV chronic prevalence (62.2%).22,23 The overall and
age-specific HCV sero-prevalence (4.8%) came from the
2007 national survey,7 adjusted for chronic prevalence. An
increasing epidemic was assumed, based on Pakistan blood
donor data suggesting HCV sero-prevalence increased by

553

0.4–2.4% over 1994–2014 (Supplementary Materials).
Age- and gender-specific HCV transmission rates were
calibrated to fit the model to these data.
Analyses of the 2007 national survey were used to estimate the population proportion and estimated HCV prevalence for the low and/or high medical and community risk
categories (defined in Supplementary Materials),24 which
were used to estimate the recruitment rate and relative risk
of HCV transmission for these categories. HCV disease progression and mortality rates were obtained from the literature, and adjusted for the high proportion of genotype 3 in
Pakistan.1,25 The public sector has undertaken treatment
with interferon (IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) since 2005,7 with
23 000 treatments between 2005 and 2010, and 45 000–
60 000 annual treatments thereafter (unpublished data from
the National and State Level Pakistan Hepatitis Control
Programs). Equivalent treatment data do not exist for the
private sector. However, health care system profile and usage
data suggest that for 1994–2014, one-fifth to one-third of
health care provision was from the public sector, with no discernable change over time.26–29 To produce a conservative
estimate of the total number of historical treatments provided nationally, we assumed a public/private sector split of
40%/60% for HCV treatment between 2005 and 2015, and
so estimated the overall treatment rate by scaling the publicsector treatment rate 2.5-fold (Supplementary Table S4,
available as Supplementary data at IJE online). For 2015,
this estimated 150 000 treatments or a 2% treatment rate
among infected individuals. The model was calibrated to
these treatment rates, evenly distributed across all infected
individuals because no disease staging was undertaken. The
treatment efficacy for IFNþRBV was estimated (SVR
50–81%) from Pakistan studies.30,31 From 2016, we
assumed treatment using new DAAs, with an SVR of 80–
95%.4 We assume no treatment for individuals with ESLD.
To account for parameter uncertainty, we calibrated the
model within a probabilistic uncertainty analysis framework. Uncertainty was incorporated in most model parameters and calibration data, with each being sampled 1000
times from the distributions in Supplementary Tables S2
and S3 (available as Supplementary data at IJE online).
For each sampled parameter set, other model parameters
(as discussed above) were varied to fit the model to the
calibration data using a non-linear least squares algorithm
(Matlab). Overall, 328 model runs fit the data and were
used for subsequent analyses.

Model analyses
The calibrated model projected the evolution of the epidemic until 2030, with no further treatment from 2016.
We determined the proportion of new HCV infections

(2016–30) that could be prevented if the elevated risk
among PWID or individuals with high medical and community risk were removed. In comparison with this baseline, we projected the impact of a range of HCV
prevention and treatment interventions (described in first
column of Table 1) on the epidemic dynamics and burden
of HCV-related morbidity over 15 years (2016–30 inclusive). These scenarios assumed no targeting of treatment.
We then considered what levels of treatment would be
needed to reduce the Pakistan HCV epidemic to low levels as
advocated by WHO: an 80% reduction in incidence and
65% reduction in HCV-related mortality by 2030, both
compared with 2015 levels.5 Different intervention strategies
were modelled: (A) No additional prevention, with treatment
given equally to all individuals; (B) No additional prevention,
with up to 80% of cirrhosis cases treated annually, and the
rest treated equally; (C) No additional prevention, with up
to 80% of cirrhosis cases treated annually, priority targeting
of treatment to PWID (at twice the rate compared with noncirrhotic non-PWID), and the rest treated equally; (D–F)
Treatment scenario (C) with either injecting drug use-related

transmission risk, high medical and community risk, or all
transmission risks (among PWID and those with low and
high medical and community risk) halved.

Uncertainty analysis
We undertook a linear regression analysis of covariance to
determine which parameter and calibration data uncertainties contributed most to the variability in the 15-year impact
on prevalence, incidence and mortality of a 50% reduction
in transmission risk across all groups, and 5% treatment rate
per year. The proportion of each model outcome’s sum-ofsquares contributed by each parameter was calculated to estimate their importance to the overall uncertainty.

Results
Epidemic projections with no further treatment
Between 2016 and 2030, the population of Pakistan is projected to increase by a third to approximately 250 million,
and chronic HCV prevalence will increase from 3.9% (95%

credibility interval 3.7–4.1%) to 5.1% (4.6–5.5%)
(Figure 2a, b; Supplementary Table S5, available as
Supplementary data at IJE online). Due to these changes, the
number of prevalent chronic infections will rise from 7.5
(7.2–7.9) to 12.6 (11.8–13.6) million, and annual incident
infections will rise from 700 000 (620 000–780 000) to 1.1
(1.0–1.3) million (from 3.7 to 4.8 per 1000 person-years).
Large increases in HCV-related disease will also occur
(Figure 3c, d), with 1.4 (1.0–2.0) million HCV-related deaths
among those aged over 20 years during this period.

Heterogeneities in transmission risk
Compared with the overall HCV incidence [3.7 (3.3–4.2) per
1000 person-years (pyrs) in 2016], and HCV incidence
among individuals with low community and medical risk
[2.8 (2.4–3.2) per 1000 pyrs], PWID have a much higher incidence [366.9 (277.8–490.5) per 1000 pyrs] which, if this
risk is removed, would avert 13.9% (9.8–18.2%) of new infections over 2016–30 (Supplementary Table S5, available as
Supplementary data at IJE online). Conversely, high community risk was associated with a slightly increased HCV incidence[4.3 (3.7–5.0) per 1000 pyrs by itself and 5.0 (4.1–5.9)
per 1000pyrs when combined with high medical risk],
whereas high medical risk by itself was not strongly associated [3.3 (2.8–3.7) per 1000 pyrs]. If both high community
and medical risks were removed over 2016–30, 30.8%
(19.5–46.5%) of new HCV infections would be prevented.

Potential impact of intervention scenarios
Figure 3 and Table 1 show the potential impact of various
intervention scenarios, demonstrating that the HCV

epidemic in Pakistan can only be attenuated if transmission
risk is reduced or improvements in treatment occur. For instance, a 30% decrease in all transmission risks (PWID
and low/high community and medical risks) could stabilize
chronic prevalence and would avert 38.1% of new infections over 2016–30, but few HCV-related deaths would be
prevented (< 5%). Similarly, continuing current treatment
rates (2.0% of infections or 150 000 treated annually),
while also switching to DAAs, could also stabilize prevalence and would reduce HCV-related mortality by 7.2%
over 2016–30, but fewer new infections would be prevented (10.4%). Further impact is achieved through combining interventions, but none of these initial scenarios
thus considered achieve the WHO elimination targets.

Requirements for reaching WHO HCV elimination
targets
To reach the WHO HCV elimination targets by 2030, the
model suggests that substantial treatment scale-up is
required (Figure 4). With no targeting of treatment, and no
scale-up in prevention, 880 000 (750 000–1 100 000) annual treatments are needed over 2016–30. However, targeting treatment to people with cirrhosis with up to 80%
annual coverage results in fewer treatments, requiring
810 000 (590 000–1 100 000) annually to reach the same
targets, whereas also targeting PWID (at twice the treatment rate of non-cirrhotic non-PWID) requires 750 000
(670 000–880 000) annual treatments. These annual treatment targets are reduced further if either the HCV transmission risk due to injecting drug use is halved (reduces by
50 000), all high-risk factors are halved (by 100 000) or all

interventions are as indicated.

transmission risks are halved (by 200 000). For all intervention scenarios, fewer treatments are needed to reach the
WHO incidence target compared with the combined mortality and incidence targets (Figure 4).

Uncertainty analysis
For halving all transmission risks and treating 5% of
chronic infections annually, analyses of covariance
(Supplementary Figure S5, available as Supplementary data

at IJE online) indicate that much of the variability in the impact on incidence is due to uncertainty in the chronic HCV
prevalence amongst PWID (46.8% of variability), whereas
most variability in the impact on mortality is due to uncertainty in the HCC progression rate (65.6%). Conversely, for
the impact on prevalence, most variability is due to uncertainty in the DAA SVR rate (47.2%), which also affects incidence (17.5%) and mortality (14.6%). Lastly, the
population growth rate affects the impact on prevalence
(29.5%) and incidence (17.1%), but not mortality.

intervention scenarios without (Intervention Scenarios A to C) or with HCV risk reduction interventions (Intervention Scenarios D to F). The treatment
intervention scenarios considered were: (A) Non-targeted treatment; (B) Targeted treatment towards 80% of chronically infected people with cirrhosis
each year; (C to F) Targeted treatment towards 80% of cirrhosis cases and treating PWID at twice the rate of non-PWID. Three HCV risk reduction interventions were considered: (D) Halve HCV transmission risk due to injecting drug use; (E) Halve HCV transmission risk due to injecting drug use and
high medical and community risk factors and, lastly, (F) Halve transmission risk amongst PWID as well as amongst those with low and high community and medical risk. Whiskers denote the 95% credibility intervals around all projections.

Discussion
Best estimates indicate that Pakistan currently harbours
one-tenth of the global HCV burden. Our analyses suggest
that without further treatment interventions, this HCV
burden will increase further by 2030, with the number of
prevalent and incident infections increasing by two-thirds
to 1.1 million new infections annually and 12.6 million
prevalent chronic infections, and close to 1.5 million individuals dying from ESLD. To reverse this increasing burden, and so reach the WHO elimination targets for HCV
by 2030, a substantial scale-up in treatment is required,
with at least 525 000 treatments being needed per year if
treatment is targeted towards PWID and people with cirrhosis, and prevention activities also halve current transmission risk. However, if prevention activities have little
impact, then 750 000 individuals will need treatment annually, or 880 000 if treatment is also not targeted to priority groups. These results highlight the urgent need for
operationalizing country-wide prevention and treatment
interventions to control the HCV epidemic in Pakistan,
and the importance of strategies for prioritizing treatment
to optimize the impact achieved. The only country currently undertaking a comparable number of treatments is
Egypt, where 500 000 patients were treated between
January and September 2016.32 For Pakistan to initiate a
similar undertaking, a major commitment will be needed
from Pakistan federal and provincial governments.
Many nations worldwide are developing elimination
strategies, with 79 countries in the process of or having

developed national action plans by early 2017.2,33,34 In
April 2015, Georgia began a countrywide programme to
eliminate HCV by 2020, with nearly 8500 individuals initiating treatment by April 2016.35 Similarly, other LMICs
are working towards achieving HCV elimination within
the next decade.32,34
In Pakistan, first-line treatment for chronic HCV infection is changing to the new DAAs. Extensive negotiations
with pharmaceutical companies, along with competition
from generic DAAs, have resulted in substantial price reductions for generic sofosbuvir, recently reaching US$15
for a 28-day supply (one treatment unit) in the public sector.32 This has set the stage for a scale-up in treatment by
the public sector. Although drug costs are higher in the private sector (US$300 for a 28-day supply of sofosbuvir),
rapid increases in sales suggest treatment is scaling up in the
private sector, with 1.1 million treatment units procured
between January 2016 and August 2017; data were accessed from IQVIA, formerly Intercontinental Marketing
Statistics Health and Quintiles [https://www.iqvia.com].
However, the quality of treatment, including adherence and
retention to therapy, remains an issue in Pakistan;30 this
could become more acute as generic DAAs become readily
available across Pakistan.
A major obstacle confronting all HCV elimination programmes is the identification of infected individuals, which
will entail considerable screening. The implementation of
nationwide screening programmes will be essential, as few
(< 5%) HCV-infected individuals in LMICs know their

558

International Journal of Epidemiology, 2018, Vol. 47, No. 2

status.32 In Pakistan, this will require screening of the general population, due to the diffuse nature of the country’s
HCV epidemic; this could be optimized through targeting
subpopulations with higher prevalence and improving the
linkage to treatment following diagnosis. Although beneficial for reducing HCV-related mortality, prioritization of
HCV treatment for cirrhosis cases could present further
challenges, requiring effective follow-up of diagnosed precirrhotic individuals who may have to wait for treatment.
This will require improvements in the Pakistan health care
infrastructure to enable them to achieve the WHO HCV
elimination targets.

is uncertainty in these estimates, the small impact achieved
by existing treatment rates suggests it is unlikely to affect
our model projections. Going forward, our model considered the overall treatment rate needed for achieving
elimination, but did not consider how this will be achieved.
Despite evidence suggesting recent treatment scale-up in
the private sector (see earlier in Discussion), it is possible
that, over time, the public sector will provide a larger share
as treatment is expanded to those with little access to
health care. From a policy perspective, it will be important
to determine the contribution of different health care providers for expanding treatment.

Strengths and limitations

Comparison with other studies

The main strength of our analysis is that we present the
first full dynamic transmission and disease progression
model of an LMIC HCV epidemic calibrated to detailed
context-specific data. However, limitations still exist. First,
the national HCV survey7 used to parameterize the model
only asked about ever exposure for most HCV risk factors,
and used HCV antibody status to measure HCV exposure,
which may have occurred long before the survey.
Reassuringly, similar risk factors were reported among
younger and older individuals, suggesting the same risk
factors may be driving HCV transmission at the time of the
survey as in the past. Other data limitations include insufficient Pakistan-specific HCV-related progression rates,
which may differ due to variations in such things as alcohol
consumption or obesity.18
Second, although this analysis used a relatively complex
model, it still did not incorporate complexities such as geographical heterogeneity in the Pakistan HCV epidemic or
intra-familial transmission.24 Despite this, our model is
still useful for projecting the impact of different national
treatment and prevention strategies.
Third, our projections considered the impact of reducing specific aspects of transmission risk without defining
how this could be achieved. Unfortunately, other than for
PWID-targeted HCV prevention interventions,36,37 little
evidence exists on the effectiveness of HCV prevention
interventions, except for blood safety. Despite this limitation, our analyses do reveal potential targets for prevention
interventions, including everyday practices such as barbering, and health care-related risks due to unsafe medical injections. It is now important to design, undertake, and
evaluate potential interventions to target these risk
modalities.
Fourth, we did not have data on HCV treatment numbers for the private sector, and so derived estimates before
2017 based on assuming a stable split between public/private health care provision in Pakistan.26–29 Although there

Our study is unique in providing the first full estimation
of the treatment requirements for achieving the WHO
HCV elimination targets for both incidence and mortality
in a generalized epidemic setting. Other HCV modelling
studies have considered specific high-risk groups,38–40 or
the evolving burden of HCV for specific countries without
considering the transmission dynamics of HCV.12,14,15
These latter studies cannot estimate the impact of prevention and treatment interventions on HCV incidence, and
so could not assess what was needed for reaching the
WHO incidence target. Additionally, the only previous
model for Pakistan dramatically underestimated the yearly
incidence of new HCV infections (230 000 instead of
500 000 in 2014) due to it not incorporating the expanding nature of the Pakistan population and HCV epidemic.15 Conversely, only two studies, both considering
Egypt, have modelled the transmission dynamics of HCV
in a generalized HCV epidemic setting,16,17 evaluating the
treatment requirements for reducing incidence to low levels. Our study adds to these analyses by being the first to
estimate the requirements for achieving both incidence
and mortality elimination targets, and by evaluating the
additional benefits of targeting treatment and scaling up
prevention interventions – something that is crucial for
reducing the large treatment burden. We also consider an
expanding epidemic setting, contrasting with Egypt, with
our results suggesting more treatments will be needed in
Pakistan than in Egypt to achieve the WHO incidence
target.41

Conclusion and implications
This study directly addresses the feasibility of eliminating
hepatitis at a national level, a pre-requisite to achieving
global elimination as set out in the World Health Assembly
resolution. It highlights the considerable effort needed to
reach the WHO HCV elimination targets in high-burden

settings such as Pakistan. Any global effort to eliminate
HCV will have to give special attention to tackling the
HCV epidemics in such settings, due to their large contribution to the global epidemic. To succeed in reducing both
mortality and incidence, and to minimize the required
treatment capacity, these efforts should target testing and
treatment interventions to those with disease and those
with transmission potential. This should also involve the
scale-up of prevention interventions which can dramatically decrease the treatment requirements for reducing
incidence.
